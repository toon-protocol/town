# Crosstown Protocol Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for **Crosstown Protocol**, including the core library packages, shared services, agent runtime, UI prototypes, and integration patterns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
The `ui-prototypes` package contains React-based UI prototypes for visualizing the agent network. These are design exploration tools, not production frontend code. No separate Frontend Architecture Document is required.

### 1.1 Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** No starter template. This is a greenfield TypeScript monorepo using standard pnpm/TypeScript tooling configured manually.

**Rationale:** Specialized protocol library with unique Nostr + ILP requirements. Manual setup provides complete control over tooling without removing unnecessary boilerplate. The project has grown from a 3-package library to a 5-package monorepo with Docker deployment and an autonomous agent runtime.

## 2. High Level Architecture

### 2.1 Technical Summary

Crosstown Protocol is a **TypeScript monorepo** with a **modular package architecture**. The system consists of four packages plus a Docker entrypoint that enable autonomous agents to discover ILP payment peers via Nostr social graphs, exchange SPSP parameters with settlement negotiation over Nostr events, and run as autonomous LLM-powered agents that process Nostr events in real-time.

The architecture separates concerns across three layers:

1. **Discovery & Configuration** — Nostr handles peer discovery, SPSP exchange, and social graph traversal
2. **Payment Routing** — ILP connectors handle actual packet routing, settlement, and payment channels
3. **Autonomous Decision-Making** — LLM-powered handlers process Nostr events and execute structured actions (planned, Epic 11)

The library acts as a bridge — populating ILP connector routing tables from Nostr social graph data. In embedded mode (`createCrosstownNode()`), the connector runs in-process with zero-latency function calls.

### 2.2 High Level Overview

1. **Architectural Style:** Library/SDK with modular package structure + autonomous agent runtime
2. **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with `@crosstown/core`, `@crosstown/bls`, `@crosstown/relay`, `@crosstown/examples`, plus `docker/` entrypoint
3. **Service Architecture:** Library consumed by agents, with optional embedded connector mode and standalone Docker deployment
4. **Integration Patterns:**
   - **Embedded Mode:** `createCrosstownNode()` wires ConnectorNode + BLS + Bootstrap + RelayMonitor in-process (zero-latency)
   - **HTTP Mode:** Library in agent process communicates with connector via Admin API (separate processes)
   - **Docker Mode:** Standalone container running BLS + relay + bootstrap as a service

### 2.4 Architectural and Design Patterns

| Pattern                         | Application                                                                        | Rationale                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Modular Monorepo**            | Package organization (core, bls, relay, examples)                                  | Simplifies dependency management; enables atomic changes across packages |
| **Event-Driven Architecture**   | Nostr pub/sub for discovery, SPSP, and real-time monitoring                        | Natural fit for Nostr; enables real-time updates via RelayMonitor        |
| **Composition Pattern**         | `createCrosstownNode()` wires all components with start/stop lifecycle             | Single entry point for embedded mode; avoids manual component wiring     |
| **Interface Abstraction**       | `AgentRuntimeClient` / `ConnectorAdminClient` with HTTP and direct implementations | Swap between embedded and HTTP mode without changing consumer code       |
| **Layered Peer Discovery**      | Genesis peers → ArDrive registry → NIP-02 social graph                             | Progressive fallback ensures bootstrap works even with minimal network   |
| **Strategy Pattern**            | Configurable trust calculation weights                                             | Agents can tune trust weights without code changes                       |
| **Builder Pattern**             | Event builder utilities for all Nostr event kinds                                  | Ensures correct event structure, tagging, and signing                    |
| **Deterministic Event Routing** | Kind number → handler dispatch (not LLM classification)                            | Predictable, testable routing; LLM decides actions within handlers       |
| **Business Logic Server (BLS)** | Payment verification and TOON-encoded event processing                             | Standard ILP integration pattern; extracted as reusable package          |
| **State Machine**               | Bootstrap phases: discovering → registering → handshaking → announcing → ready     | Clear lifecycle with event-driven phase transitions                      |

- `CLOSE` - Close subscriptions

**Event Kinds Used:**

| Kind  | Name                 | Usage                                                          |
| ----- | -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 3     | Follow List (NIP-02) | Peer discovery via social graph                                |
| 10032 | ILP Peer Info        | Connector address, BTP endpoint, settlement chains             |
| 23194 | SPSP Request         | Encrypted request for SPSP parameters + settlement negotiation |
| 23195 | SPSP Response        | Encrypted response with SPSP params + negotiated settlement    |

**Integration Notes:** Library uses nostr-tools SimplePool for relay management. All tests mock SimplePool to avoid live relay dependency. RelayMonitor provides real-time subscription to kind:10032 events for dynamic peer discovery.

### 6.2 agent-runtime Connector

- **Purpose:** ILP connector for packet routing, peer management, and payment channels
- **Documentation:** https://github.com/anthropics/agent-runtime

**Integration Modes:**

| Mode         | Transport                 | Latency | Configuration                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Embedded** | In-process function calls | Zero    | `createCrosstownNode()` with ConnectorNode |
| **HTTP**     | REST API                  | Network | `createHttpRuntimeClient(baseUrl)`         |

**Key API Surfaces (both modes):**

| Operation              | HTTP Endpoint             | Direct Method                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Send ILP packet        | `POST /ilp/send`          | `connector.sendPacket()`      |
| Add peer               | `POST /admin/peers`       | `connector.registerPeer()`    |
| Remove peer            | `DELETE /admin/peers/:id` | `connector.removePeer()`      |
| Handle incoming packet | `POST /handle-packet`     | `bls.handlePacket()` (public) |
| Open payment channel   | `POST /admin/channels`    | `connector.openChannel()`     |
| Get channel state      | `GET /admin/channels/:id` | `connector.getChannelState()` |

**Integration Notes:** `@agent-runtime/connector` is an optional peer dependency. HTTP-only mode works without it. Both HTTP and direct clients implement the same `AgentRuntimeClient` / `ConnectorAdminClient` interfaces.

### 6.3 ArDrive Peer Registry

- **Purpose:** Decentralized peer registry for bootstrap when NIP-02 social graph is empty
- **Base URL(s):** ArDrive transaction queries
- **Authentication:** None (public read)

**Integration Notes:** ArDrivePeerRegistry provides fallback peer discovery. Genesis peers → ArDrive → NIP-02 forms the layered discovery stack.

    COMP->>BS: start() (discover, register, handshake, announce)
    COMP->>RM: start() (monitor for new kind:10032 events)

    Note over App,RM: All ILP packets flow in-process (zero latency)

    App->>COMP: node.stop()
    COMP->>RM: stop()
    COMP->>BS: stop()
```

## 8. Database Schema

The BLS and relay packages use SQLite for event persistence. Schema follows NIP-01 event structure.

```sql
-- Events table
CREATE TABLE events (
    id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,           -- Event ID (hash)
    pubkey TEXT NOT NULL,          -- Author public key
    kind INTEGER NOT NULL,         -- Event kind
    content TEXT NOT NULL,         -- Event content
    tags TEXT NOT NULL,            -- JSON-encoded tags array
    created_at INTEGER NOT NULL,   -- Unix timestamp
    sig TEXT NOT NULL,             -- Schnorr signature
    received_at INTEGER NOT NULL   -- When relay received event
);

-- Indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX idx_events_pubkey ON events(pubkey);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_kind ON events(kind);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_created_at ON events(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_events_pubkey_kind ON events(pubkey, kind);

-- For replaceable events (kinds 10000-19999)
-- Application logic handles replacement on insert
```

**Design Notes:**

- Tags stored as JSON for flexibility
- `received_at` tracks when relay received event (for debugging/auditing)
- Replaceable events handled in application layer (delete old, insert new)
- No foreign keys; events are self-contained
- InMemoryEventStore available for testing (same interface)

## 10. Infrastructure and Deployment

### 10.1 Infrastructure as Code

- **Tool:** Docker for containerized deployment
- **Location:** `docker/Dockerfile`
- **Approach:** Library packages published to npm; Docker image for standalone relay+BLS deployment

### 10.2 Deployment Strategy

- **Strategy:** Dual deployment — npm packages + Docker images
- **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions
- **Pipeline Configuration:** `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

**npm Publishing Flow:**

1. Version bump in package.json files (coordinated across packages)
2. Create git tag
3. GitHub Actions builds and tests
4. Publish to npm registry (@crosstown/core, @crosstown/bls, @crosstown/relay)

**Docker Publishing Flow:**

1. Build from `docker/Dockerfile`
2. Image includes BLS + relay + bootstrap entrypoint
3. Configure via environment variables

### 10.3 Environments

- **Development:** Local development with mocked relays and in-memory stores
- **Integration Testing:** Five-peer bootstrap test with mocked connectors (`vitest.integration.config.ts`)
- **CI:** GitHub Actions runners with full test suite
- **npm Registry:** Published packages for consumers
- **Docker:** Standalone container deployment

### 10.4 Environment Promotion Flow

```
Local Dev → PR → main branch → Tagged Release → npm publish / Docker build
     ↓         ↓                     ↓                    ↓
  Unit Tests  CI Tests         Publish to npm       Push Docker image
  Integration                                       (manual trigger)
```

### 10.5 Rollback Strategy

- **npm:** npm unpublish (within 72 hours) or deprecate + new patch version
- **Docker:** Tag previous image version; roll back container
- **Trigger Conditions:** Critical bugs, security vulnerabilities, broken builds
- **Recovery Time Objective:** < 1 hour for npm deprecation + patch

---

## 11. Error Handling Strategy

### 11.1 General Approach

- **Error Model:** Custom error classes extending Error with error codes and cause chaining
- **Exception Hierarchies:** Separate hierarchies per package
- **Error Propagation:** Errors thrown from library; consumers handle

**Core Package (`@crosstown/core`):**

```typescript
class CrosstownError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public readonly code: string,
    cause?: Error
  ) {
    super(message, { cause });
  }
}

class InvalidEventError extends CrosstownError {} // INVALID_EVENT
class PeerDiscoveryError extends CrosstownError {} // PEER_DISCOVERY_FAILED
class SpspError extends CrosstownError {} // SPSP_FAILED
class SpspTimeoutError extends CrosstownError {} // SPSP_TIMEOUT
class TrustCalculationError extends CrosstownError {} // TRUST_CALCULATION_FAILED
```

**BLS Package (`@crosstown/bls`):**

```typescript
class BlsBaseError extends Error {
  constructor(
    message: string,
    public code: string
  ) {}
}

class BlsError extends BlsBaseError {} // BLS_ERROR
class ConfigError extends BlsBaseError {} // CONFIG_ERROR
```

**ILP Error Codes (BLS):** `F00` (bad request), `F06` (insufficient amount), `T00` (internal error)

### 11.2 Logging Standards

- **Library (core):** No built-in logging; throws descriptive errors with context
- **BLS Package:** Uses console with structured output; consumers can replace
- **Docker Entrypoint:** Console logging with environment-configurable levels

### 11.3 Error Handling Patterns

#### External API Errors (Nostr Relays)

- **Retry Policy:** Query multiple relays; continue on individual failures
- **Circuit Breaker:** Not implemented; rely on relay redundancy
- **Timeout Configuration:** Configurable per operation (default 10s for SPSP, 5s for discovery)
- **Error Translation:** Relay errors wrapped in library error types

#### Business Logic Errors

- **Custom Exceptions:** `InvalidEventError`, `SpspTimeoutError`, `PeerDiscoveryError`, `BlsError`
- **Error Codes:** `INVALID_EVENT`, `SPSP_TIMEOUT`, `PEER_DISCOVERY_FAILED`, `BLS_ERROR`, `CONFIG_ERROR`
- **ILP Error Mapping:** BLS maps domain errors to ILP error codes (F00, F06, T00)

#### Bootstrap Errors

- **Event-Based:** Bootstrap emits typed events for phase failures (`bootstrap:handshake-failed`, `bootstrap:announce-failed`)
- **Partial Success:** Bootstrap continues with remaining peers if individual peers fail
- **Phase Rollback:** Failed phase transitions emit events; consumers decide retry strategy

#### Data Consistency

- **Transaction Strategy:** SQLite transactions for relay event storage
- **Compensation Logic:** N/A (single-operation writes)
- **Idempotency:** Events identified by hash; duplicate writes ignored

---

## 12. Coding Standards

### 12.1 Core Standards

- **Languages & Runtimes:** TypeScript ^5.3.x (strict mode), Node.js 24.x
- **Style & Linting:** ESLint 9.x (flat config) + Prettier 3.x (config in repo root)
- **Test Organization:** Co-located `*.test.ts` files next to source; integration tests in `__integration__/`

### 12.2 Naming Conventions

### 12.3 Critical Rules

- **Never use `any`:** Use `unknown` and type guards instead
- **Always mock SimplePool in tests:** No live relay dependencies in CI
- **Export from index.ts:** All public APIs exported from package index
- **Use nostr-tools types:** Don't redefine Nostr event types
- **Validate event signatures:** Never trust unsigned/unverified events
- **Structural typing for cross-package interfaces:** Use `ConnectorNodeLike` instead of direct import to keep `@agent-runtime/connector` as optional peer dep
- **DI for cross-package codecs:** Pass TOON encoder/decoder as config callbacks to avoid circular dependencies

## 13. Test Strategy and Standards

### 13.1 Testing Philosophy

- **Approach:** Test-after with comprehensive coverage for public APIs
- **Coverage Goals:** >80% line coverage for core and BLS packages
- **Test Pyramid:** Unit-heavy; integration tests for bootstrap flows

### 13.2 Test Types and Organization

#### Unit Tests

- **Framework:** Vitest ^1.x
- **Config:** `vitest.config.ts` (root)
- **File Convention:** `*.test.ts` co-located with source
- **Location:** Same directory as source file
- **Mocking Library:** Vitest built-in mocking (`vi.fn()`, `vi.mock()`)
- **Coverage Requirement:** >80% for public APIs

**Requirements:**

- All public methods have unit tests
- Edge cases and error conditions covered
- SimplePool always mocked (never live relays)
- Follow AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)

#### Integration Tests

- **Config:** `vitest.integration.config.ts` (root)
- **Scope:** Multi-component bootstrap flows, five-peer bootstrap test
- **Location:** `packages/*/src/__integration__/`
- **Test Infrastructure:**
  - **Mocked Connectors:** In-memory connector simulation
  - **SQLite:** In-memory for unit tests, file-based for integration
  - **Nostr Relay:** Mocked SimplePool (no live relays)

#### E2E Tests

- **Not in current scope** — planned for post-Epic 11

### 13.3 Test Data Management

- **Strategy:** Factory functions for test fixtures
- **Fixtures:** In test files or `__fixtures__/` directories
- **Factories:** Helper functions creating valid test events with proper signatures
- **JSON Fixtures:** `genesis-peers.json`, `testnet-wallets.json`
- **Cleanup:** Vitest handles; in-memory stores reset per test

### 13.4 Continuous Testing

- **CI Integration:** GitHub Actions runs `pnpm test` on all PRs
- **Performance Tests:** Not in current scope
- **Security Tests:** npm audit in CI

---

## 14. Security

### 14.1 Input Validation

- **Validation Approach:** Regex validation + nostr-tools verification at boundaries
- **Validation Location:** At library boundaries (public API methods, BLS packet handler)
- **Required Rules:**
  - All pubkeys validated as 64-character lowercase hex (`/^[0-9a-f]{64}$/`)
  - All events verified with nostr-tools `verifyEvent()` before processing
  - ILP addresses validated against format
  - TOON-decoded events re-verified after decoding

### 14.2 Authentication & Authorization

- **Auth Method:** Nostr event signatures (Schnorr/secp256k1)
- **Session Management:** N/A (stateless library)
- **Required Patterns:**
  - Always verify event signatures before processing
  - Use NIP-44 encryption for SPSP request/response
  - BLS owner pubkey bypass for self-signed events

### 14.3 Secrets Management

- **Development:** Consumer provides keypairs; library never stores keys
- **Production:** Same as development; Docker entrypoint accepts keys via env vars
- **Code Requirements:**
  - NEVER log private keys or shared secrets
  - Private keys passed as parameters, never stored
  - Shared secrets handled as opaque blobs
  - Settlement addresses and channel IDs are not secret but should not be logged at debug level

### 14.4 API Security

- **Rate Limiting:** N/A for library; Docker deployment should add relay-level rate limiting
- **CORS Policy:** N/A (library; Docker BLS is internal-only)
- **Security Headers:** N/A (library)
- **HTTPS Enforcement:** Relay consumers should enforce WSS

### 14.5 Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest:** Consumer responsibility (relay SQLite)
- **Encryption in Transit:** NIP-44 for SPSP; WSS for relay connections
- **PII Handling:** Pubkeys are pseudonymous; no PII collected
- **Logging Restrictions:** Never log private keys, shared secrets, or decrypted SPSP payloads

### 14.6 NIP Handler Security (Planned — Epic 11)

- **Content Isolation:** Untrusted event content wrapped with `<untrusted-content>` tags and `^` datamarkers before LLM processing
- **Allowlist Enforcement:** Per-kind action allowlists reject unauthorized actions
- **Rate Limiting:** Per-pubkey, per-kind rate limiting stored in SQLite
- **Audit Logging:** All LLM-decided actions logged with event ID, kind, pubkey, action, timestamp, token usage

### 14.7 Dependency Security

- **Scanning Tool:** npm audit, Dependabot
- **Update Policy:** Security patches within 48 hours
- **Approval Process:** Dependencies reviewed before adding
- **Optional Peer Deps:** `@agent-runtime/connector` is optional to minimize attack surface

### 14.8 Security Testing

- **SAST Tool:** ESLint security rules
- **DAST Tool:** Not applicable (library)
- **Penetration Testing:** Not in current scope

## 15. NIP Adoption Roadmap

The following epics extend the protocol with standardized Nostr Improvement Proposals (NIPs), building progressively from social identity to autonomous agent swarms.

### Phase 0: Social Fabric Foundation (Epic 12)

**NIPs:** NIP-05 (DNS Identity), NIP-25 (Reactions), NIP-65 (Relay List Metadata), NIP-09 (Event Deletion), NIP-56 (Reporting)

Establishes social identity, reputation signaling, and moderation primitives. Agents become first-class Nostr participants — discoverable by humans and machines, capable of expressing quality feedback, and protected from abuse.

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- `AgentProfileBuilder` — kind:0 profiles with NIP-05 identity
- `RelayListManager` — kind:10002 relay preferences for multi-relay discovery
- Reaction/report signals provide lightweight reputation inputs
- Relay event store extended with kind:5 deletion handling

### Phase 1: Paid Computation Marketplace (Epic 13)

**NIPs:** NIP-90 (Data Vending Machines), NIP-89 (Service Discovery)

Enables paid agent-to-agent computation via NIP-90 DVMs with ILP micropayments. Customer sends ILP PREPARE with TOON-encoded kind:5xxx job request; provider returns kind:6xxx result in FULFILL.

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- `DvmJobHandler` — BLS module for processing DVM job requests
- `DvmAnnouncementBuilder` — kind:31990 capability advertisements
- `DvmDiscovery` — Social-graph-weighted service provider discovery
- `DvmJobChain` — Multi-agent computation pipelines via sequential ILP payments

### Phase 2a: Trust Infrastructure — ILP Zaps (Epic 14)

**NIPs:** NIP-57 (Zaps, adapted for ILP), NIP-51 (Lists)

ILP-backed zaps with cryptographic proof-of-payment. Zap history, diversity, and settlement reliability feed into trust scores. NIP-51 lists enable explicit routing preferences.

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- ILP zap request (kind:9734) / receipt (kind:9735) event types
- `ZapHandler` in BLS for accepting zap payments and publishing receipts
- Trust metrics expanded: zapVolume, zapDiversity, settlementReliability
- Trust-weighted route priority in peer registration
- NIP-51 trusted-routes and mute lists for routing signals

### Phase 2b: Trust Infrastructure — Labels & Badges (Epic 15)

**NIPs:** NIP-32 (Labeling), NIP-58 (Badges)

Agent capability taxonomy via labels, post-service quality ratings, and verifiable badge credentials for settlement reliability and throughput milestones.

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- NIP-32 label namespaces: `agent-skill`, `agent-quality`, `agent-warning`, `agent-tier`
- `BadgeIssuer` — kind:30009 definitions, kind:8 awards, auto-issuance via metric thresholds
- Comprehensive multi-signal trust model (9 components)

### Phase 3: Communication & Content Layer (Epic 16)

**NIPs:** NIP-17 (Private DMs), NIP-10 (Threading), NIP-18 (Reposts), NIP-23 (Long-form Content), NIP-72 (Communities)

Full communication stack: metadata-private DMs, threaded discussions, content amplification, paid articles, and moderated agent communities.

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- `PrivateMessaging` — Three-layer NIP-17 encryption (rumor → seal → gift wrap)
- Threading utilities for multi-turn public discourse
- NIP-23 article authoring with ILP payment gating (already priced in BLS)
- `CommunityModerator` — Programmatic approval hooks for NIP-72 communities

### Phase 4: Advanced Patterns — Agent Swarms (Epic 17)

**NIPs:** NIP-29 (Relay-Based Groups)

Payment-gated agent swarms with ILP payment channel membership gating, hierarchical ILP address allocation, and TOON-encoded intra-swarm communication where every message is a micropayment.

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- `SwarmManager` — NIP-29 group lifecycle (create, join, dissolve)
- `MembershipValidator` — Payment channel deposit + badge + trust gating
- `SwarmAddressManager` — Hierarchical ILP address allocation (`g.swarm-<groupId>.<memberId>`)
- `SwarmMessenger` — TOON-encoded group events as ILP PREPARE packets

### Trust Score Evolution

Trust calculation is planned to evolve across phases:

```
Phase 1 (Epic 12):  reactionScore + reportPenalty
Phase 2 (Epic 14):  + zapVolume + zapDiversity + settlementReliability
Phase 3 (Epic 15):  + qualityLabelScore + badgeScore
```
