# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the overall project architecture for **Crosstown Protocol**, including the core library packages, shared services, agent runtime, and integration patterns. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

## 1.1 Starter Template or Existing Project

**Decision:** No starter template. This is a greenfield TypeScript monorepo using standard pnpm/TypeScript tooling configured manually.

**Rationale:** Specialized protocol library with unique Nostr + ILP requirements. Manual setup provides complete control over tooling without removing unnecessary boilerplate. The project has grown from a 3-package library to a 4-package monorepo with Docker deployment and an autonomous agent runtime.
