# 2. High Level Architecture

## 2.1 Technical Summary

Crosstown Protocol is a **TypeScript monorepo** with a **modular package architecture**. The system consists of four packages plus a Docker entrypoint that enable autonomous agents to discover ILP payment peers via Nostr social graphs, exchange SPSP parameters with settlement negotiation over Nostr events, and run as autonomous LLM-powered agents that process Nostr events in real-time.

The architecture separates concerns across three layers:

1. **Discovery & Configuration** — Nostr handles peer discovery, SPSP exchange, and social graph traversal
2. **Payment Routing** — ILP connectors handle actual packet routing, settlement, and payment channels
3. **Autonomous Decision-Making** — LLM-powered handlers process Nostr events and execute structured actions (planned, Epic 11)

The library acts as a bridge — populating ILP connector routing tables from Nostr social graph data. In embedded mode (`createCrosstownNode()`), the connector runs in-process with zero-latency function calls.

## 2.2 High Level Overview

1. **Architectural Style:** Library/SDK with modular package structure + autonomous agent runtime
2. **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with `@crosstown/core`, `@crosstown/bls`, `@crosstown/relay`, `@crosstown/examples`, plus `docker/` entrypoint
3. **Service Architecture:** Library consumed by agents, with optional embedded connector mode and standalone Docker deployment
4. **Integration Patterns:**
   - **Embedded Mode:** `createCrosstownNode()` wires ConnectorNode + BLS + Bootstrap + RelayMonitor in-process (zero-latency)
   - **HTTP Mode:** Library in agent process communicates with connector via Admin API (separate processes)
   - **Docker Mode:** Standalone container running BLS + relay + bootstrap as a service

## 2.4 Architectural and Design Patterns

| Pattern                         | Application                                                                        | Rationale                                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Modular Monorepo**            | Package organization (core, bls, relay, examples)                                  | Simplifies dependency management; enables atomic changes across packages |
| **Event-Driven Architecture**   | Nostr pub/sub for discovery, SPSP, and real-time monitoring                        | Natural fit for Nostr; enables real-time updates via RelayMonitor        |
| **Composition Pattern**         | `createCrosstownNode()` wires all components with start/stop lifecycle             | Single entry point for embedded mode; avoids manual component wiring     |
| **Interface Abstraction**       | `AgentRuntimeClient` / `ConnectorAdminClient` with HTTP and direct implementations | Swap between embedded and HTTP mode without changing consumer code       |
| **Layered Peer Discovery**      | Genesis peers → ArDrive registry → NIP-02 social graph                             | Progressive fallback ensures bootstrap works even with minimal network   |
| **Strategy Pattern**            | Configurable trust calculation weights                                             | Agents can tune trust weights without code changes                       |
| **Builder Pattern**             | Event builder utilities for all Nostr event kinds                                  | Ensures correct event structure, tagging, and signing                    |
| **Deterministic Event Routing** | Kind number → handler dispatch (not LLM classification)                            | Predictable, testable routing; LLM decides actions within handlers       |
| **Business Logic Server (BLS)** | Payment verification and TOON-encoded event processing                             | Standard ILP integration pattern; extracted as reusable package          |
| **State Machine**               | Bootstrap phases: discovering → registering → handshaking → announcing → ready     | Clear lifecycle with event-driven phase transitions                      |
