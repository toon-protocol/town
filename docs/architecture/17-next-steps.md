## 17.3 Architecture Document Maintenance

This document is sharded into focused files for dev agent consumption:

- `docs/architecture/2-high-level-architecture.md` - Section 2
- `docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md` - Section 3
- `docs/architecture/5-components.md` - Section 5
- `docs/architecture/9-source-tree.md` - Section 9
- `docs/architecture/12-coding-standards.md` - Section 12

The sharded files in `docs/architecture/` must be updated whenever the main `architecture.md` changes.
