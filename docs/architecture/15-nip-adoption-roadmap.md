# 15. NIP Adoption Roadmap

The following epics extend the protocol with standardized Nostr Improvement Proposals (NIPs), building progressively from cross-Town communication to full Gas Town federation. The roadmap integrates the [Crosstown x Gas Town Integration Analysis](../research/gastown-integration-analysis.md) as planned work.

## Phase 1: Cross-Town Communication Foundation (Epic 12)

**NIPs:** NIP-05 (DNS Identity), NIP-09 (Event Deletion), NIP-17 (Private DMs), NIP-25 (Reactions), NIP-40 (Expiration), NIP-46 (Remote Signing), NIP-56 (Reporting), NIP-65 (Relay List Metadata)

Establishes the communication substrate for cross-Town interaction. Agents become discoverable Nostr participants with encrypted messaging, relay redundancy, and lifecycle management. NIP-17 DMs replace filesystem-based mail for remote agents. NIP-46 remote signing enables Polecat key isolation (scoped signing without sharing Rig keypair). NIP-40 expiration auto-cleans stale claims and session events.

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- `AgentProfileBuilder` -- kind:0 profiles with NIP-05 identity
- `RelayListManager` -- kind:10002 relay preferences for multi-relay discovery
- `PrivateMessaging` -- Three-layer NIP-17 encryption (rumor -> seal -> gift wrap) for cross-Town mail
- `RemoteSignerDaemon` -- NIP-46 signer with scoped per-kind permissions for Polecats
- NIP-40 expiration tags on ownership claims, session events, DVM job requests
- Reaction/report signals provide lightweight reputation inputs
- Relay event store extended with kind:5 deletion handling

**Gastown Integration:** Phase 1 — enables two Gas Town instances to exchange messages via Nostr. A Gas Town node subscribes to a Crosstown peer's relay and publishes kind:14 DMs, kind:30078 work dispatch, and kind:10032 peer info events.

## Phase 2: Paid Computation Marketplace (Epic 13)

**NIPs:** NIP-90 (Data Vending Machines), NIP-89 (Service Discovery)

Enables paid agent-to-agent computation via NIP-90 DVMs with ILP micropayments. Customer sends ILP PREPARE with TOON-encoded kind:5xxx job request; provider returns kind:6xxx result in FULFILL. DVM bid amounts use peering-channel denomination (agreed during SPSP handshake).

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- `DvmJobHandler` -- BLS module for processing DVM job requests
- `DvmAnnouncementBuilder` -- kind:31990 capability advertisements
- `DvmDiscovery` -- Social-graph-weighted service provider discovery
- `DvmJobChain` -- Multi-agent computation pipelines via sequential ILP payments
- DVM payment flow: bid signal -> ILP PREPARE (escrow) -> work execution -> ILP FULFILL (release)

**Gastown Integration:** Phase 1-2 — DVM jobs are the work dispatch mechanism for cross-Town requests. Gas Town Mayors publish NIP-90 job requests; peer Towns claim and execute via local Polecats. Peering gate enforces that only NIP-02 peers can submit/claim DVM jobs.

## Phase 3: Trust Infrastructure & Reputation (Epic 14)

**NIPs:** NIP-32 (Labeling), NIP-51 (Lists), NIP-57 (Zaps adapted for ILP), NIP-58 (Badges), NIP-85 (Trusted Assertions)

Multi-signal trust model combining ILP-backed zaps, agent capability labels, verifiable badge credentials, and pre-computed trust oracle assertions. NIP-51 lists enable structured configuration: reviewer sets, CI provider sets, relay preferences, routing signals.

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- ILP zap request (kind:9734) / receipt (kind:9735) event types
- `ZapHandler` in BLS for accepting zap payments and publishing receipts
- NIP-32 label namespaces: `agent-skill`, `agent-quality`, `agent-warning`, `agent-tier`
- `BadgeIssuer` -- kind:30009 definitions, kind:8 awards, auto-issuance via metric thresholds
- NIP-85 trust oracle integration -- kind:30382 pre-computed trust assertions; multiple competing oracles
- NIP-51 lists: `crosstown-reviewers`, `crosstown-ci-providers`, relay sets, review queue bookmarks
- Trust metrics expanded: zapVolume, zapDiversity, settlementReliability, qualityLabelScore, badgeScore

**Gastown Integration:** Phase 2-3 — trust scores drive merge authority selection, DVM provider ranking, and federation membership tiers. NIP-85 oracles replace expensive BFS computation at scale. NIP-51 lists scope which Towns can review patches and run CI.

## Phase 4: Decentralized Git Collaboration (Epic 15)

**NIPs:** NIP-34 (Git Stuff), NIP-29 (Relay-Based Groups -- project scope), NIP-32 (Labeling -- review namespace), NIP-77 (Negentropy)

Cross-Town code collaboration via NIP-34. Towns contribute patches (kind:1617) to shared codebases, reviewed via NIP-32 labels (`crosstown.review` namespace), merged by trust-weighted consensus (no centralized Integration Refinery). NIP-29 project groups scope per-repository coordination. NIP-77 enables efficient catch-up after network partitions.

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- NIP-34 event handlers: kind:30617 (repo announcement), kind:30618 (repo state), kind:1617 (patch), kind:1618 (PR), kind:1619 (PR update), kind:1630-1633 (status events)
- `CrossTownReviewAggregator` -- NIP-32 label aggregation with trust-weighted approval threshold
- `MergeAuthoritySelector` -- highest-trust approver with push access applies patches
- `ConflictDetectionDvm` -- NIP-90 DVM (kind:5951/6951) for pre-merge conflict detection
- `OwnershipClaimManager` -- kind:30078 advisory file-level claims with NIP-40 expiration
- NIP-29 project groups: trust-driven membership (admin/moderator/member), relay-enforced scoping
- NIP-77 negentropy sync for efficient delta recovery after partition (80-95% bandwidth reduction)
- Merge trust composition: `0.30*social + 0.25*merge_success_rate + 0.20*code_quality + 0.15*payment_reliability + 0.10*maintainer_tenure`

**Gastown Integration:** Phase 3 — the core of cross-Town code collaboration. Gas Town Refineries publish patches to Nostr; peer Town Mayors review and label; trust-weighted consensus determines merge authority. Corresponds to Section 3 of the [integration analysis](../research/gastown-integration-analysis.md).

## Phase 5: Content & Community Layer (Epic 16)

**NIPs:** NIP-10 (Threading), NIP-18 (Reposts), NIP-23 (Long-form Content), NIP-53 (Live Activities), NIP-72 (Communities)

Agent discourse infrastructure: threaded discussions, content amplification, paid long-form articles, live activity monitoring, and moderated communities.

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- Threading utilities for multi-turn public discourse (NIP-10 reply tags)
- NIP-23 article authoring with ILP payment gating (already priced in BLS)
- `LiveActivityPublisher` -- NIP-53 kind:30311 for merge session monitoring, agent work sessions
- `CommunityModerator` -- Programmatic approval hooks for NIP-72 communities
- Merge session collision prevention via NIP-53 (active merge sessions visible to all Towns)

**Gastown Integration:** Phase 3-4 — NIP-53 live activities replace tmux-based Witness monitoring for remote agents. Merge authorities publish live merge sessions; Deacons monitor for stuck sessions.

## Phase 6: Cross-Town Federation & Agent Swarms (Epic 17)

**NIPs:** NIP-29 (Relay-Based Groups -- federation scope)

Town-to-Town federation grounded in the Gas Town model. A Gas Town Town is an agent swarm (Mayor + Polecats). The Wasteland federation protocol is replaced by Nostr/ILP: Towns peer via NIP-02 + SPSP, form NIP-29 federation groups with payment-gated membership, and coordinate via hierarchical ILP addressing. Every cross-Town message is an ILP packet.

**Key Architectural Additions:**

- `FederationManager` -- NIP-29 federation group lifecycle (Town join/leave/promote/demote)
- `MembershipValidator` -- Peering gate + payment channel deposit + badge + trust threshold gating
- `FederationAddressManager` -- Hierarchical ILP address allocation (`g.<town>.<rig>.<agent>`)
- `FederationMessenger` -- TOON-encoded group events as ILP PREPARE packets
- `WastelandMigrator` -- Maps DoltHub tables (towns, wanted, completions, stamps, badges) to Nostr event equivalents
- MEOW/DVM workflow mapping -- Formula→DVM Job, Molecule→Job+Feedback chain, Wisp→kind:7000, Convoy→parallel DVM jobs

**Gastown Integration:** Phase 3-4 — full convergence of Gas Town and Crosstown into a distributed agent marketplace. Towns federate via Nostr relays, dispatch work via NIP-90 DVMs with ILP payment, and coordinate shared codebases via NIP-34.

## Trust Score Evolution

Trust calculation is planned to evolve across phases:

```
Phase 0 (current):  w1*socialDistance + w2*mutualFollowers + w3*reputationScore
Phase 1 (Epic 12):  + w4*reactionScore + w5*reportPenalty
Phase 2 (Epic 13):  + w6*dvmSuccessRate + w7*dvmReliability
Phase 3 (Epic 14):  + w8*zapVolume + w9*zapDiversity + w10*settlementReliability
                    + w11*qualityLabelScore + w12*badgeScore
Phase 4 (Epic 15):  + w13*mergeSuccessRate + w14*codeQualityHistory + w15*maintainerTenure
```
