# Crosstown Protocol - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Goals and Background Context

### 1.1 Goals

- Enable autonomous AI agents to discover ILP payment peers from their Nostr follow lists without manual configuration
- Provide SPSP parameter exchange over Nostr events with settlement negotiation, eliminating HTTPS/DNS/TLS dependencies
- Derive trust-based credit limits from social graph relationships (social distance, mutual followers, reputation)
- Deliver a reference implementation of ILP-gated Nostr relays with pay-to-write spam resistance
- Provide a standalone BLS Docker image for plug-and-play integration
- Implement layered peer discovery (genesis peers, ArDrive registry, NIP-02 social graph) for reliable network bootstrap
- Support embedded connector mode for zero-latency in-process ILP routing alongside HTTP mode
- Publish core packages to npm for downstream consumption
- Establish the protocol as the standard for Nostr+ILP integration with formal NIP submissions

### 1.2 Background Context

Traditional ILP infrastructure struggles with peer discovery (requires manual config or centralized registries), SPSP handshakes (heavyweight HTTPS dependencies), and trust bootstrapping (no data-driven basis for credit limits). For autonomous AI agents, these problems are acute—agents need to transact programmatically, discover counterparties dynamically, and make trust decisions without human intervention.

The convergence of Nostr's growth as decentralized identity infrastructure, rising interest in autonomous AI agents, ILP's maturity as a payment protocol, and the need for spam-resistant relay infrastructure creates the ideal moment for Crosstown Protocol. The core insight: **your Nostr follows become your ILP peers, and social distance informs financial trust.**

The project has evolved from initial peer discovery concepts to a comprehensive 4-package monorepo with Docker deployment, embedded connector integration, settlement negotiation, layered peer discovery, and production-ready npm packages (v1.1.1).

## 2. Requirements

### 2.1 Functional Requirements

**Core Protocol (Epics 1-4)**

- **FR1:** The library SHALL discover ILP peers by querying NIP-02 follow lists from configured Nostr relays
- **FR2:** The library SHALL query kind:10032 (ILP Peer Info) events to retrieve connector ILP addresses, BTP endpoints, settlement capabilities, and settlement addresses for discovered peers
- **FR3:** The library SHALL subscribe to peer updates and notify consumers when peer info changes via RelayMonitor
- **FR4:** The library SHALL support dynamic SPSP handshakes via kind:23194 (SPSP Request) and kind:23195 (SPSP Response) ephemeral events with NIP-44 encryption
- **FR5:** The library SHALL handle incoming kind:23194 SPSP requests and respond with kind:23195 encrypted responses
- **FR6:** The library SHALL compute trust scores based on social distance (hops in follow graph)
- **FR7:** The library SHALL provide a configurable trust calculator that can incorporate mutual followers, reputation (zaps), and historical payment success
- **FR8:** The library SHALL provide TypeScript interfaces for all ILP-related Nostr event kinds (10032, 23194, 23195)
- **FR9:** The library SHALL provide parser and builder utilities for ILP event kinds
- **FR10:** The ILP-gated relay reference implementation SHALL accept ILP payments for event writes using TOON-encoded events in ILP packets

- **FR12:** The ILP-gated relay SHALL serve NIP-01 reads over WebSocket without payment
- **FR13:** The ILP-gated relay SHALL bypass payment requirements for the agent's own events (self-write)

**BLS & Docker (Epic 5)**

- **FR14:** The BLS SHALL be extracted as a standalone package (`@crosstown/bls`) with independent build and deployment
- **FR15:** The BLS Docker image SHALL implement the standard BLS contract (`/health`, `/handle-packet`) for agent-runtime integration
- **FR16:** The BLS SHALL be configurable via environment variables (NODE_ID, NOSTR_SECRET_KEY, ILP_ADDRESS, pricing, storage)
- **FR17:** The BLS SHALL persist events to SQLite on a mounted volume, with in-memory fallback

**Layered Discovery & Bootstrap (Epics 6, 8)**

- **FR18:** The library SHALL provide layered peer discovery: genesis peers (hardcoded JSON) → ArDrive registry (decentralized) → NIP-02 social graph (dynamic)
- **FR19:** The library SHALL implement a multi-phase bootstrap lifecycle: discovering → registering → handshaking → announcing → ready
- **FR20:** The bootstrap service SHALL send SPSP handshakes as ILP packets via `POST /ilp/send` on agent-runtime
- **FR21:** The bootstrap service SHALL publish kind:10032 peer announcements as paid ILP packets after initial handshake

**Settlement Negotiation (Epic 7)**

- **FR24:** The SPSP responder SHALL open payment channels via the connector Admin API during handshake, returning channelId in the response

## 3. Technical Assumptions

### 3.1 Repository Structure: Monorepo

The project uses a pnpm monorepo with four packages plus Docker deployment:

- `@crosstown/core` - Main protocol library (discovery, SPSP, trust, bootstrap, compose) - **Published v1.1.1**
- `@crosstown/bls` - Standalone Business Logic Server (payment verification, TOON, pricing, storage) - **Published v1.1.1**
- `@crosstown/relay` - ILP-gated Nostr relay reference implementation - **Published v1.1.1**
- `@crosstown/examples` - Integration examples (private, not published)
- `docker/` - Standalone Docker entrypoint for BLS deployment

**Rationale:** Monorepo simplifies dependency management between packages and enables atomic changes. The BLS was extracted (Epic 5) for independent Docker deployment.

### 3.2 Service Architecture

The project provides both a **library** and **deployable services**. Three integration modes are supported:

1. **Embedded Mode:** `createCrosstownNode()` wires ConnectorNode + BLS + Bootstrap + RelayMonitor in-process with zero-latency function calls
2. **HTTP Mode:** Library in agent process communicates with connector via Admin API (separate processes)
3. **Docker Mode:** Standalone container running BLS + relay + bootstrap as a service via `docker/src/entrypoint.ts`

**Rationale:** Embedded mode provides optimal performance for agents importing the library directly. HTTP mode supports isolated deployments. Docker mode enables plug-and-play integration with agent-runtime.

### 3.3 Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests:** Required for all public APIs using Vitest with mocked SimplePool
- **Integration Tests:** Five-peer bootstrap test with mocked connectors (`vitest.integration.config.ts`)
- **E2E Tests:** Not in current scope

**Rationale:** Mocked tests ensure CI reliability without external dependencies. Integration tests validate multi-component bootstrap flows.

### 3.4 Additional Technical Assumptions

- Agents own their Nostr keypairs; the library does not manage keys
- NIP-44 encryption is stable and supported by nostr-tools
- agent-runtime Admin API remains stable for peer/route/channel management
- Nostr relays reliably serve replaceable events (kind:10032)
- TOON encoding via `@toon-format/toon` for ILP packet data
- pnpm workspaces for monorepo management
- tsup for library bundling (ESM output)
- `@crosstown/connector` is an optional peer dependency for embedded mode
- Static SPSP publishing (kind:10047) was removed — SPSP uses only encrypted request/response (kind:23194/23195) to protect shared secrets
