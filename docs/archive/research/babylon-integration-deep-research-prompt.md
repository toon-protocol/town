# Deep Research Prompt: Babylon Social Integration with Crosstown & Agent-Runtime

## Research Objective

Investigate and recommend the optimal technical architecture for integrating **Babylon Social** (a multiplayer prediction market game with autonomous AI agents), **Crosstown** (a Nostr+ILP protocol for social-graph-driven peer discovery, trust derivation, and payment routing), and a planned **agent-runtime** (ILP connector/packet router). The research must identify where these three systems create compound value — specifically: how Babylon's social prediction markets, A2A protocol, and agent framework can be enhanced by Crosstown's decentralized trust engine and ILP micropayment infrastructure, and how Crosstown's protocol gains a high-value application layer through Babylon. The agent-runtime serves as the ILP packet routing bridge between them.

The research should produce actionable integration architectures, protocol interoperability maps, and a prioritized implementation roadmap that maximizes value across all three projects without creating unnecessary coupling.

## Background Context

### Project 1: Babylon Social

**Repository:** https://github.com/babylonSocial/babylon/
**Documentation:** https://docs.babylon.market/
**Nature:** Multiplayer prediction market game with autonomous AI agents and continuous RL training

**Core Architecture:**

- Monorepo (Bun/Turbo): `apps/web` (Next.js), `packages/engine`, `packages/agents`, `packages/a2a`, `packages/mcp`, `packages/db`, `packages/contracts`, `packages/training`
- PostgreSQL (Neon) + Redis (Upstash) + Base L2 smart contracts (EIP-2535 Diamond pattern)
- Game engine generates conspiracy-themed narrative worlds with NPCs, organizations, causal events
- Tick-based simulation with LLM-driven content generation (OpenAI/Groq)

**Key Subsystems:**

1. **Prediction Markets** — Binary YES/NO contracts resolving in 1-7 days. Constant Product AMM pricing. On-chain settlement on Base.
2. **Perpetual Futures** — 1-100x leverage on 32 in-game company tickers. 8-hour funding rate cycles. Liquidation engine.
3. **Social Feed** — Twitter-like timeline with NPCs, AI agents, and human players posting. Feed content drives market prices.
4. **Alpha Groups** — Invitation-only NPC-led intelligence channels. Engagement-gated access.
5. **Autonomous Agent Framework** (`packages/agents`) — `AutonomousCoordinator` orchestrates posting, trading, commenting, DMs, group chat, A2A interactions per tick cycle.
6. **A2A Protocol** (`packages/a2a`) — Google's Agent-to-Agent protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP). Agent cards at `.well-known/agent-card.json`. Task-based communication. Blockchain registry for on-chain agent registration. X402 payment manager.
7. **MCP Server** (`packages/mcp`) — Model Context Protocol server exposing Babylon functionality as tools for external AI systems.
8. **RL Training Pipeline** (`packages/training`) — GRPO via Atropos framework. Base model: Qwen2.5-3B-Instruct. Trajectory logging → AI judge scoring → policy optimization.
9. **Smart Contracts** — Prediction markets, perpetual futures, liquidity pools, oracles, ERC-8004 identity registry, ERC-8004 reputation system, compute registry/staking, ProtoMonkeysNFT (ERC-721 leaderboard rewards).
10. **Agent Templates** — Pre-built archetypes: degen, researcher, social-butterfly, perps-trader, scammer, super-predictor, information-trader.

**Agent Capabilities:**

- Autonomous trading (prediction markets + perpetual futures)
- Social posting, commenting, DMs, group chats
- A2A inter-agent communication
- On-chain identity via ERC-8004
- Portfolio management and risk assessment

**Points Economy:**

- In-game currency and reputation system
- Earned through trading profit, profile completion, social account linking, referrals
- Cannot be purchased, transferred, or lost below -100

### Project 2: plugin-babylon (ElizaOS Integration)

**Repository:** https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-babylon/tree/odi-dev
**Nature:** ElizaOS plugin enabling autonomous AI agents to operate on Babylon

**Core Architecture:**

- Full ElizaOS plugin: 14 actions (write operations), 14+ providers (multi-resolution read), 2 services, 2 background tasks, 3 routes
- Two operating modes: Player Mode (conversational) and Autonomous Mode (independent decision-making)
- Batch processing pipeline with global event pump (singleton per Babylon instance URL)

**Key Innovations:**

1. **Two-Phase Batch Pipeline** — Phase 1: Single LLM call routes ALL new posts to relevant agents (shared router). Phase 2a: Per-agent comment drafting (batched LLM). Phase 2b: Post-triggered trading evaluation.
2. **Spartan Trader Pattern** — LLM sets exit conditions (stop-loss, take-profit, sentiment threshold) at position entry. Position monitoring is deterministic (no LLM) — runs every 2 minutes with simple numeric comparisons.
3. **Sentiment System** — Keyword-based extraction (zero LLM cost), EMA-smoothed (alpha=0.1), minimum 3 posts before triggering exits.
4. **Market Detection** — Regex-based pattern matching on social posts to identify market-relevant content (no LLM).
5. **Multi-Resolution Providers** — Dynamic context injection at 3 levels (overview/medium/full) to optimize token usage.
6. **On-Chain Identity** — ERC-8004 agent registration on Base Sepolia via `BabylonIdentityService`.
7. **A2A Service** — WebSocket-based Agent-to-Agent protocol for real-time inter-agent communication (80+ methods).

**Token Efficiency:**

- CSV format prompts (~60% savings vs JSON)
- Batched LLM calls across multiple posts
- NO-LLM position monitoring
- Keyword-based sentiment (zero cost)
- Regex market detection
- Smart deduplication

### Project 3: Crosstown Protocol

**Repository:** The current project (this codebase)
**Nature:** Nostr+ILP protocol library — social graphs become payment peer networks

**Core Architecture:**

- Monorepo: `@crosstown/core` (protocol library), `@crosstown/relay` (ILP-gated relay), `@crosstown/bls` (standalone Business Logic Server), `ui-prototypes` (React 19 + Tailwind v4), `examples`
- Nostr event kinds: 10032 (ILP Peer Info), 23194/23195 (encrypted SPSP request/response)
- NIP-44 encryption for SPSP parameter exchange
- TOON binary encoding for Nostr events in ILP packets
- Docker container for bootstrap node (BLS + relay)

**Key Subsystems:**

1. **Peer Discovery** — NIP-02 follow lists → ILP peer candidates. `SocialPeerDiscovery` for graph traversal. `GenesisPeerLoader` for bootstrap. `ArDrivePeerRegistry` for decentralized lookup.
2. **SPSP over Nostr** — `NostrSpspClient`/`NostrSpspServer` for encrypted SPSP parameter exchange with settlement negotiation. Fresh `sharedSecret` per payment session.
3. **Social Trust Engine** — `SocialTrustManager` computes trust from: social distance (hops, weight 0.5), mutual followers (weight 0.3), reputation/zaps (weight 0.2). Maps to ILP credit limits (linear/exponential curves).
4. **ILP-Gated Relay** — Nostr relay where writing events requires ILP micropayment. BLS handles payment verification. `PricingService` for per-kind event pricing.
5. **Bootstrap Service** — 5-phase flow: Discover → Register peers → SPSP handshakes → Open payment channels → Announce self.
6. **TOON Encoding** — Compact binary serialization of Nostr events for ILP packet data payloads.

**14-Epic Roadmap (Current State):**

| Epic | Title                                                           | Status                                        |
| ---- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1-6  | Foundation, SPSP, Trust, Relay, Docker, Decentralized Discovery | Complete                                      |
| 7-8  | Settlement Negotiation & ILP-First Bootstrap                    | Mostly Complete (2 critical integration gaps) |
| 9    | Social Fabric Foundation (UI prototypes)                        | In Progress                                   |
| 10   | Paid Computation Marketplace (Agent DVMs via NIP-90)            | Planned                                       |
| 11   | ILP Zaps & Social Routing                                       | Planned                                       |
| 12   | Agent Labels & Verifiable Credentials (NIP-32/58)               | Planned                                       |
| 13   | Private Messaging & Content Layer                               | Planned                                       |
| 14   | Payment-Gated Agent Swarms (NIP-29)                             | Planned                                       |

**Critical Integration Gaps:**

- BLS `/handle-payment` missing settlement negotiation logic (Gap 1)
- `ConnectorChannelClient` HTTP implementation never created (Gap 2)
- Bootstrap phases 3-5 have integration gaps blocking multi-hop payments

### Project 4 (Planned): Agent-Runtime

**Nature:** ILP connector / packet router — the bridge between social discovery and payment execution
**Current State:** Interface exists in Crosstown (`AgentRuntimeClient` with `sendIlpPacket()` via `POST /ilp/send`). No standalone runtime implementation yet.

**Intended Role:**

- Routes ILP packets between peers
- Manages BTP connections
- Handles settlement channels (Base L2, XRP Ledger, Aptos)
- Manages balances and credit limits (populated by Crosstown's trust engine)
- Exposes Admin API for peer/route/channel management
- Has NO Nostr knowledge — Crosstown populates it

**Key Interface:**

```typescript
interface AgentRuntimeClient {
  sendIlpPacket(params: {
    destination: string;
    amount: string;
    data: string; // base64 TOON-encoded Nostr events
    timeout?: number;
  }): Promise<IlpSendResult>;
}
```

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions (Must Answer)

1. **Protocol Bridge Architecture:** How should agent-runtime bridge Babylon's A2A protocol (JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP/WebSocket) with Crosstown's ILP packet routing (PREPARE/FULFILL/REJECT with TOON-encoded Nostr events)? What translation layer is needed? Should A2A tasks map to ILP payment flows, or should they remain separate communication channels?

2. **Trust Model Unification:** Crosstown computes trust from Nostr social graphs (distance, mutuals, zaps). Babylon has its own reputation system (ERC-8004 on-chain reputation, points economy, leaderboard ranking, trading P&L history). How should these trust signals be unified? Should Babylon's trading performance feed into Crosstown's credit limits? Should Crosstown's social trust influence Babylon's agent reputation scores?

3. **Payment Layer for Babylon:** Babylon currently uses virtual points and on-chain Base L2 contracts for market settlement. How could ILP micropayments via Crosstown add real economic value? Specific scenarios to evaluate:
   - ILP payments for A2A agent-to-agent service requests (replacing or supplementing X402)
   - ILP settlement for prediction market positions (parallel to or replacing on-chain settlement)
   - ILP micropayments for Alpha Group access or premium feed content
   - ILP-funded DVM compute jobs (Crosstown Epic 10) triggered by Babylon market events

4. **Agent Identity Convergence:** Babylon uses ERC-8004 NFTs on Base Sepolia for agent identity. Crosstown uses Nostr keypairs (npub/nsec) as agent identity. How should these identities be linked? Options include:
   - NIP-05 verification pointing to ERC-8004 registry
   - Dual-identity with cross-reference (Nostr pubkey stored in ERC-8004 metadata, ERC-8004 token ID stored in kind:0 profile)
   - Agent-runtime as identity bridge (maps Nostr pubkeys to EVM addresses)
   - Shared keypair derivation (e.g., Nostr key → EVM key via deterministic path)

5. **Agent-Runtime as Integration Hub:** What should agent-runtime's architecture look like to serve BOTH as an ILP connector for Crosstown AND as a capable agent on Babylon? Should it:
   - Be a standalone service that Crosstown populates (current design) AND that Babylon agents connect to?
   - Embed an ElizaOS runtime with plugin-babylon for Babylon participation?
   - Expose both ILP packet routing AND A2A protocol endpoints?
   - Run Babylon's AutonomousCoordinator alongside ILP routing?

6. **ElizaOS as Integration Framework:** Should ElizaOS (via plugin-babylon) serve as the agent-runtime framework? ElizaOS already provides: plugin architecture, action/provider/service abstractions, background tasks, multi-model LLM support. Could an `@elizaos/plugin-crosstown` be built alongside plugin-babylon to give agents both Babylon trading AND ILP payment capabilities?

7. **Data Flow Architecture:** Map the complete data flow for a realistic cross-system scenario:
   - Agent discovers a market-moving signal on Babylon's social feed
   - Agent uses ILP micropayment to request DVM analysis from a trusted peer (Crosstown Epic 10)
   - Agent opens a prediction market position on Babylon based on the analysis
   - Agent shares the thesis on the Nostr social layer (Crosstown)
   - Social engagement (zaps) on the thesis adjusts trust scores for the analyst peer

### Secondary Questions (Nice to Have)

8. **Babylon's Training Pipeline + Crosstown:** Could Crosstown's trust scores serve as additional reward signals in Babylon's GRPO training? Higher-trust agents get higher reward weights? Could RL-trained Babylon agents be deployed as Crosstown peers?

9. **Settlement Chain Alignment:** Babylon uses Base L2. Crosstown supports Base, XRP Ledger, and Aptos for settlement. Is Base the natural common settlement layer? Should agent-runtime's channel management unify Babylon contract interactions with ILP settlement channels?

10. **NIP-90 DVMs on Babylon:** Crosstown's Epic 10 defines paid computation via NIP-90 DVM pattern. Babylon's game engine generates narrative content via LLM. Could Babylon agents offer DVM services (market analysis, sentiment scoring, narrative summarization) that Crosstown agents pay for via ILP?

11. **Payment-Gated Swarms in Babylon:** Crosstown's Epic 14 defines NIP-29 payment-gated agent swarms. Babylon has Alpha Groups (invitation-only intelligence channels). Could Alpha Groups become payment-gated swarms where membership requires ILP channel deposits?

12. **Nostr Relay as Babylon Feed Alternative:** Crosstown's ILP-gated relay could host a parallel social layer to Babylon's centralized PostgreSQL-backed feed. Would a Nostr-native feed layer add censorship resistance or decentralization value to Babylon?

13. **MCP Convergence:** Babylon has an MCP server exposing game functionality. Crosstown could expose trust queries, peer discovery, and ILP operations as MCP tools. Should there be a unified MCP surface that combines both?

14. **Competitive Landscape:** How does this three-way integration compare to other agent-to-agent payment systems? Specifically: NEAR AI agent payments, Fetch.ai ASI Alliance, Autonolas/Olas, SingularityNET marketplace, and any Nostr-native agent payment experiments.

15. **plugin-babylon Architecture Patterns for Crosstown:** The plugin-babylon codebase contains several innovative patterns (two-phase batch pipeline, Spartan trader, multi-resolution providers, CSV token optimization). Which of these patterns should be adopted or adapted for an `@elizaos/plugin-crosstown` or for agent-runtime design?

### Analysis Frameworks

1. **Protocol Interoperability Matrix** — For each pair of systems (Babylon↔Crosstown, Babylon↔agent-runtime, Crosstown↔agent-runtime), map: shared concepts, translation requirements, data format mismatches, authentication/identity gaps.

2. **Value Flow Analysis** — Trace how value (economic, informational, reputational) flows between systems. Identify where integration creates compound value (1+1=3) vs. where it creates friction.

3. **Coupling Assessment** — For each proposed integration point, evaluate: coupling tightness (loose/medium/tight), failure isolation (does one system's downtime affect others?), evolution independence (can systems upgrade independently?).

4. **Build vs. Adapt vs. Bridge** — For each integration need, evaluate: build new (custom integration), adapt existing (modify one system to speak the other's protocol), or bridge (translation middleware).

5. **Incremental Adoption Path** — Prioritize integrations that deliver value with minimal changes to either system, then layer deeper integrations.

### Data Requirements

- Authentication and identity mechanisms in each system
- Data models and schemas (especially where they overlap: agent identity, reputation, social relationships)

## Success Criteria

The research achieves its objectives if:

1. **Architecture is actionable** — A developer could start implementing the first integration phase within a week using only this research document
2. **Trade-offs are explicit** — Every architectural decision includes alternatives considered and reasons for the recommendation
3. **Coupling is minimized** — The architecture allows each project to evolve independently; integration is via well-defined interfaces
4. **Value is quantified** — Each integration point has a clear statement of what new capability it enables that none of the three projects could achieve alone
5. **Roadmap is sequenced** — Dependencies between integration steps are mapped; no step requires work that hasn't been planned
6. **Risks are identified** — Technical risks (protocol mismatches, performance bottlenecks, identity conflicts) are catalogued with mitigations
7. **All three projects benefit** — The integration creates value for Babylon (stronger agent ecosystem, real economic incentives), Crosstown (high-value application layer, agent-runtime design clarity), and plugin-babylon/ElizaOS (expanded capabilities, new revenue streams for agents)

## Constraints and Boundaries

### In Scope

- Technical integration architecture between all three systems
- agent-runtime design recommendations that serve both Crosstown and Babylon
- Protocol interoperability (Nostr ↔ A2A ↔ ILP ↔ MCP ↔ EVM)
- Identity and trust model unification
- ElizaOS plugin strategy for Crosstown
- Patterns and lessons from plugin-babylon applicable to Crosstown

### Out of Scope

- Babylon's internal game balance or narrative design changes
- Crosstown's internal NIP proposals or Nostr protocol extensions (beyond what's in the 14-epic roadmap)
- Smart contract modifications to Babylon's Diamond proxy
- RL training pipeline changes (beyond noting where trust scores could be reward signals)
- UI/UX design for the integration (Crosstown Epic 9 handles this separately)
