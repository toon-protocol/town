# Deep Research Prompt: Human-Facing UI for Crosstown Protocol

## Research Objective

Investigate and recommend the optimal UI paradigm and social-media-inspired visualization approach for **non-agent human users** to observe, understand, and interact with the **Nostr social layer** of Crosstown — a protocol where autonomous agents use Nostr social graphs for ILP peer discovery, trust derivation, and payment routing. The UI must make agent-to-agent social activity (follows, peer discovery, zaps, trust scores, DVMs, communities) legible and engaging for humans. **ILP connector internals (packet routing, balances, settlement mechanics) are out of scope** — those belong to the separate agent-runtime project.

## Background Context

### What Crosstown Is

Crosstown is the Nostr integration layer that bridges social relationships to Interledger Protocol. It does NOT route payments itself — it populates a separate ILP connector (agent-runtime) with peers, trust-derived credit limits, and route priorities discovered from the Nostr social graph.

### Architecture (Critical for Scoping the UI)

```
Human Users  ←──── THIS UI (what we're researching)
    │
    ▼
@crosstown/protocol (Nostr social layer)
  - Peer discovery via NIP-02 follow lists
  - SPSP handshakes via encrypted Nostr events
  - Trust scores from social graph + zaps + reputation
  - ILP-gated relay (pay-to-write, free-to-read)
    │
    │ populates (Admin API calls)
    ▼
agent-runtime (ILP connector - SEPARATE PROJECT, OUT OF SCOPE FOR THIS UI)
  - Routes ILP packets
  - Manages BTP connections
  - Handles settlement channels
  - Has its own admin/monitoring surface
```

| 7-8    | Settlement Negotiation & Bootstrap      | SPSP handshake events, channel opening notifications                                                                       |
| **9**  | **Social Fabric Foundation**            | **NIP-05 identities, NIP-65 relay lists, NIP-25 reactions, NIP-09 deletions, NIP-56 reports**                              |
| **10** | **Paid Computation Marketplace (DVMs)** | **NIP-90 job requests/results, agent service listings, micropayment flows**                                                |
| **11** | **ILP Zaps & Social Routing**           | **kind:9734 zap requests, kind:9735 receipts with fulfillment proofs, trust score updates, NIP-51 route preference lists** |
| **12** | **Capability Labels & Credentials**     | **NIP-32 labels (settlement reliability, throughput), NIP-58 badges**                                                      |
| **13** | **Private Messaging & Content**         | **NIP-17 DMs, NIP-10 threads, NIP-18 reposts, NIP-23 paid articles, NIP-72 communities**                                   |
| **14** | **Payment-Gated Agent Swarms**          | **NIP-29 relay-based groups with payment membership gating**                                                               |

### ILP Zap Flow (Epic 11 — Critical Detail)

These are NOT Lightning zaps. They use ILP with cryptographic proof-of-payment:

```
Zapper → kind:9734 ILP zap request (with p=recipient, amount, relays)
       → ILP PREPARE (amount=zap, data=TOON-encoded request)
       → Recipient BLS validates, accepts payment
       ← ILP FULFILL (fulfillment=SHA256)
       → Recipient publishes kind:9735 receipt with fulfillment proof to relays
       → SocialTrustManager observes receipt → updates trust scores
```

Zaps feed into a 7-component trust formula: social distance, mutual followers, reaction score, zap volume, zap diversity, settlement reliability, and report penalty.

### Trust Score Formula (from Epic 11)

```
trustScore = w1*socialDistance + w2*mutualFollowers + w3*reactionScore
           + w4*zapVolume(30d) + w5*zapDiversity + w6*settlementReliability
           + w7*reportPenalty
```

Default weights: 0.25, 0.15, 0.1, 0.15, 0.1, 0.15, 0.1

### Nostr Ecosystem Context

Nostr clients already provide diverse social experiences: microblogging (Damus, Primal), long-form (Habla), marketplace (Plebeian Market), chat (0xchat), streaming (Zap.stream), communities (NIP-72). The Crosstown UI should feel native to this ecosystem while adding a unique lens on agent activity.

### Nostr Event Kinds Used by Crosstown

| Kind    | Name            | Purpose                                                                       |
| ------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `10032` | ILP Peer Info   | Replaceable event with connector's ILP address, BTP endpoint, settlement info |
| `23194` | SPSP Request    | NIP-44 encrypted request for fresh SPSP parameters                            |
| `23195` | SPSP Response   | NIP-44 encrypted response with SPSP destination_account and shared_secret     |
| `9734`  | ILP Zap Request | Zap request with ILP amount and relay targets                                 |
| `9735`  | ILP Zap Receipt | Zap receipt with fulfillment proof and trust signal                           |

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions (Must Answer)

1. **What social media paradigm best represents a network of autonomous agents performing social-financial activity on Nostr?**
   - A "feed" of agent social events (follows, zaps, DVM jobs, reactions) — like a Nostr client filtered to agent activity?
   - A spatial/graph visualization of the social trust network — where nodes pulse with zap activity and edges thicken with trust?
   - A "colony" or "ecosystem" metaphor — agents as organisms in a living system, where zaps are nourishment and trust is symbiosis?
   - A game-like interface — agent profiles as characters with stats (trust score, zap volume, settlement reliability)?
   - A marketplace/bazaar view — showcasing DVM capabilities (Epic 10), paid articles (Epic 13), gated communities (Epic 14)?
   - Something entirely novel that doesn't map to existing paradigms?

2. **How should the UI represent the rich, multi-layered trust system?**
   - Trust scores have 7 components with different weights — how to make this legible without overwhelming?
   - Zap volume and diversity are Sybil-resistant reputation signals — how to visualize "earned trust" vs "social proximity trust"?
   - NIP-51 trusted-routes and mute lists let agents curate their routing preferences — should humans see/edit these?
   - NIP-56 reports create negative trust signals — how to surface abuse prevention without creating a toxic experience?

3. **How should ILP zaps (kind:9734/9735) be presented differently from Lightning zaps?**
   - ILP zaps have cryptographic fulfillment proofs — is this a differentiator worth showing?
   - Zap receipts carry settlement chain info and ILP amounts — how much detail matters to a human?
   - Zaps feed trust scores in real-time — should the UI show the trust-score-updating effect of a zap?
   - Should humans be able to initiate zaps through the UI, or only observe agent-to-agent zaps?

4. **What novel visualization approaches could make the Nostr social graph + trust system intuitive?**
   - Animated trust score changes as zaps flow (receipts appear → trust components update → route priority shifts)?
   - "Reputation aura" or visual indicators that encode the multi-dimensional trust breakdown?
   - Time-lapse of network formation (bootstrap → peer discovery → zap accumulation → trust maturation)?
   - Sonification of network activity (distinct sounds for follows, zaps, DVM jobs, channel events)?
   - A "social weather map" where trust density = temperature and zap flow = wind patterns?

5. **How should the UI account for the full Epic 9-14 roadmap — especially DVMs (10), labels/badges (12), messaging (13), and swarms (14)?**
   - DVMs (Epic 10): Should the UI be an agent service marketplace where humans can browse and commission agent computations?
   - Labels/Badges (Epic 12): NIP-32 labels and NIP-58 badges as visual achievements/certifications on agent profiles?
   - Messaging (Epic 13): NIP-17 DMs and NIP-72 communities as social spaces where humans observe or participate alongside agents?
   - Swarms (Epic 14): Payment-gated NIP-29 groups — how to visualize coordinated agent collectives?

6. **What is the ideal level of human interactivity?**
   - **Spectator:** Pure observation of agent social/financial activity
   - **Curator:** Humans edit follow lists, trust preferences (NIP-51), mute lists to influence their agent's behavior
   - **Participant:** Humans post alongside agents in communities, send zaps, commission DVM jobs
   - **Operator:** Humans configure trust weights, bootstrap parameters, relay preferences
   - Should different user types get different views?

### Secondary Questions (Nice to Have)

7. **Should the UI be a standalone web app or a Nostr client extension/plugin?**
   - Could it be a "lens" or "filter" applied to existing Nostr clients like Primal or Coracle?
   - Or does the agent-specific data model require a purpose-built client?

8. **How to handle the dual identity — agents have Nostr keypairs but humans oversee them?**
   - First-person (see the network through your agent's eyes)?
   - Third-person (observe your agent as one node among many)?
   - Toggle between perspectives?

9. **What Nostr identity integration should the UI use?**
   - NIP-07 browser extension (nos2x, Alby)?
   - NIP-46 remote signing (Nostr Connect)?
   - NIP-05 human-readable addresses for display?

10. **Are there precedents for "spectator mode" UIs for autonomous agent systems?**
    - Multi-agent simulation viewers (NetLogo, Mesa)?
    - DAO dashboards (Colony.io, DAOhaus, Snapshot)?
    - AutoGPT/CrewAI observer interfaces?
    - DeFi social dashboards (DeBank social feed, Nansen Smart Money)?

11. **Could the UI create its own Nostr event kinds for human-readable agent activity narratives?**
    - e.g., "Your agent discovered 3 peers via Alice's follow list, zapped Bob 500 units, and trust score for Carol increased from 0.6 → 0.78"
    - This would make agent activity shareable as normal Nostr notes
