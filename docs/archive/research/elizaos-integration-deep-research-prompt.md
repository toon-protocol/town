# Deep Research Prompt: ElizaOS Plugin Integration with Crosstown Protocol

## Research Objective

Investigate and recommend the optimal technical architecture for building an **ElizaOS plugin** (`@elizaos/plugin-crosstown` or `@crosstown/elizaos-plugin`) that wraps the **Crosstown protocol** — enabling any ElizaOS-powered AI agent to participate in Nostr-based ILP payment networks with social-graph-driven peer discovery, trust derivation, and micropayment routing.

The research must produce:

1. A detailed plugin architecture mapping Crosstown's capabilities to ElizaOS's component model (Actions, Providers, Services, Evaluators, Events, Routes)
2. A concrete implementation plan showing how ElizaOS agents gain Nostr identity, discover ILP peers, negotiate SPSP handshakes, compute trust scores, and route payments — all through natural agent conversation and autonomous decision-making
3. Analysis of how Crosstown's 5-phase bootstrap process maps to ElizaOS's agent lifecycle
4. Recommendations for agent Character configuration patterns that leverage social trust for payment decisions
5. A prioritized implementation roadmap with clear milestones

The goal is to make the Interledger Protocol accessible to any ElizaOS agent through the Crosstown bridge — an agent says "pay Alice 5 USD" and the plugin handles peer discovery, SPSP negotiation, trust verification, and ILP packet routing automatically.

## Background Context

### Project 1: Crosstown Protocol

**Repository:** https://github.com/ALLiDoizCode/crosstown
**Nature:** TypeScript monorepo library bridging Nostr and Interledger Protocol (ILP)

**Core Architecture:**

- Monorepo (pnpm workspace): `packages/core` (protocol library), `packages/bls` (Business Logic Server), `packages/relay` (ILP-gated Nostr relay), `packages/examples`, `packages/ui-prototypes`
- Built on `nostr-tools 2.20.0`, `better-sqlite3`, `hono 4.x`, `@toon-format/toon`
- Node.js 20+, TypeScript, ESM output via `tsup`

**Key Subsystems:**

1. **Peer Discovery** (`NostrPeerDiscovery`) — Queries NIP-02 kind:3 follow lists to discover ILP peers, then fetches kind:10032 (ILP Peer Info) events for each followed pubkey. Returns `Map<string, IlpPeerInfo>` with ILP addresses, BTP endpoints, settlement chains, and token preferences. Supports real-time subscription to peer updates. Additional sources: `GenesisPeerLoader` (bootstrap JSON), `ArDrivePeerRegistry` (Arweave permanent registry).

2. **SPSP Client/Server** (`NostrSpspClient` / `NostrSpspServer`) — Encrypted request/response over Nostr (kind:23194 request, kind:23195 response, NIP-44 encryption). Client sends SPSP request with settlement preferences, waits for response with `destinationAccount`, `sharedSecret`, and negotiated settlement details. Server handles incoming requests, generates fresh SPSP params, performs settlement chain negotiation, and opens payment channels via `ConnectorChannelClient`.

3. **Social Trust Manager** (`SocialTrustManager`) — Computes trust scores (0-1) from social graph analysis: BFS social distance (weight 0.5), mutual follower count (weight 0.3), reputation placeholder (weight 0.2, future NIP-57 zaps). Maps trust scores to credit limits via configurable linear/exponential curves. Default max social distance: 3 hops.

4. **Bootstrap Service** (`BootstrapService`) — 5-phase state machine for network initialization:
   - Phase 1: `discovering` → Load peers from genesis/ArDrive/environment
   - Phase 2: `registering` → Query kind:10032 & register peers with ILP connector
   - Phase 3: `handshaking` → SPSP via ILP packets for settlement negotiation
   - Phase 4: `announcing` → Publish own kind:10032 as paid ILP PREPARE
   - Phase 5: `ready` → Signal bootstrap complete
     Emits typed events: `bootstrap:phase`, `bootstrap:peer-registered`, `bootstrap:channel-opened`, `bootstrap:handshake-failed`, `bootstrap:announced`, `bootstrap:ready`.

5. **ILP-Gated Relay** (`NostrRelayServer` + `BusinessLogicServer`) — Pay-to-write Nostr relay. Events encoded to TOON format, sent as ILP PREPARE packet data. BLS verifies payment amount against pricing service, stores event, returns fulfillment (SHA256 of eventId). Free reads via standard NIP-01 WebSocket queries.

6. **Event System** — Three custom Nostr event kinds:
   - `kind:10032` (ILP Peer Info) — Replaceable event with ILP address, BTP endpoint, supported chains, settlement addresses, preferred tokens
   - `kind:23194` (SPSP Request) — NIP-44 encrypted request for fresh SPSP parameters
   - `kind:23195` (SPSP Response) — NIP-44 encrypted response with SPSP data + settlement negotiation result

**Key TypeScript Interfaces:**

```typescript
interface IlpPeerInfo {
  ilpAddress: string; // e.g., "g.agent.alice"
  btpEndpoint: string; // WebSocket URL
  assetCode: string; // e.g., "USD"
  assetScale: number; // Decimal places
  supportedChains: string[]; // e.g., ["evm:base:8453", "xrp:mainnet"]
  settlementAddresses: Record<string, string>;
  preferredTokens: Record<string, string>;
  tokenNetworks: Record<string, string>;
}

interface TrustScore {
  score: number; // 0-1 normalized
  socialDistance: number; // Hops in follow graph
  mutualFollowerCount: number;
  breakdown: { socialDistanceScore; mutualFollowersScore; reputationScore };
}

interface SpspInfo {
  destinationAccount: string; // ILP address to send to
  sharedSecret: string; // Base64-encoded STREAM secret
}

// Client interfaces for connector integration
interface ConnectorAdminClient {
  addPeer(config): Promise<void>;
  removePeer(peerId): Promise<void>;
}
interface AgentRuntimeClient {
  sendIlpPrepare(prepare): Promise<IlpReply>;
}
interface ConnectorChannelClient {
  openChannel(params): Promise<OpenChannelResult>;
  getChannelState(channelId): Promise<ChannelState>;
}
```

**Known Integration Gaps (as of Feb 2026):**

- `ConnectorChannelClient` implementation incomplete
- BLS `/handle-payment` doesn't wire settlement negotiation end-to-end
- `NostrSpspServer` not fully configured with settlement params in entrypoint
- Overall 60-75% complete on settlement/ILP flow

### Project 2: ElizaOS Agent Framework

**Documentation:** https://docs.elizaos.ai/
**Source Documentation:** https://docs.elizaos.ai/llms-full.txt
**Nature:** Framework for building autonomous AI agents with configurable personalities, persistent memory, and extensible capabilities

**Core Architecture:**

1. **Characters vs Agents** — Characters are static configuration blueprints (personality, capabilities, plugins). Agents are live runtime instances with status tracking, lifecycle management, and persistent state.

2. **Plugin System** — Self-contained modules contributing components to the runtime:
   - **Actions** — Executable tasks triggered by agent decisions. Validate applicability, handle execution with streaming callbacks, report results. Have names, descriptions, and similes for LLM selection.
   - **Providers** — Data contributors to agent state composition. Run in parallel during state assembly, merge results into context. Inform decision-making without blocking.
   - **Services** — Long-running background processes. Lifecycle methods (start/stop), handle reconnection, coordinate through runtime.
   - **Evaluators** — Post-processing assessment of message exchanges. Run after action execution, store evaluation results.
   - **Events** — Plugin-defined custom events for inter-component communication.
   - **Routes** — REST/WebSocket endpoints for external system interaction.
   - **Model Handlers** — LLM call implementations with fallback support.

3. **Memory System** — Unified with embeddings:
   - Creation: Messages generate vector embeddings for semantic search
   - Retrieval: Recency-based, semantic search (vector similarity), keyword filtering
   - Composition: State assembly pulls recent memories and provider data into context window
   - Types: Short-term (conversation), long-term (marked facts), knowledge (static/learned)

4. **Message Processing Pipeline:**
   1. Pre-processing → Plugin hooks validate/modify incoming messages
   2. State composition → Providers gather contextual data
   3. Action selection → LLM chooses applicable action from registered set
   4. Execution → Selected action runs with streaming callback support
   5. Evaluation → Registered evaluators assess outcomes
   6. Storage → Memories persist with embeddings

5. **Key Interfaces:**

```typescript
interface Plugin {
  name: string;
  dependencies?: string[];
  priority?: number;
  init?: (config: any, runtime: IAgentRuntime) => Promise<void>;
  actions?: Action[];
  providers?: Provider[];
  services?: (typeof Service)[];
  evaluators?: Evaluator[];
}

interface IAgentRuntime {
  // Memory operations
  createMemory(memory: Memory): Promise<void>;
  getMemories(options: MemoryQuery): Promise<Memory[]>;
  searchMemories(query: string): Promise<Memory[]>;
  // State composition
  composeState(message: Memory): Promise<State>;
  // Component registration
  registerAction(action: Action): void;
  registerProvider(provider: Provider): void;
  registerService(service: Service): void;
}
```

6. **Multi-Agent Support** — Hierarchical parent-child delegation, shared memory spaces via roomId/worldId grouping, inter-agent message routing.

### Project 3: Existing ElizaOS Plugin Patterns (Reference)

**plugin-babylon** (https://github.com/elizaos-plugins/plugin-babylon/) — ElizaOS plugin for Babylon prediction markets. Demonstrates:

- 14 actions for trading, social posting, market analysis
- 14+ providers for multi-resolution data reads
- 2 services for background monitoring
- Two operating modes: Player (conversational) and Autonomous (independent)
- Batch processing pipeline with shared LLM routing
- Spartan Trader pattern: LLM sets exit conditions at entry, monitoring is deterministic

This plugin serves as a reference architecture for complex ElizaOS integrations.

## Research Questions

### Primary Questions (Must Answer)

1. **Plugin Architecture Design**: What is the optimal mapping of Crosstown's capabilities to ElizaOS plugin components? Specifically:
   - Which Crosstown operations become **Actions** (user/agent-triggered) vs **Services** (background processes)?
   - What **Providers** should surface trust scores, peer status, payment channel state, and balance information into agent context?
   - How should **Evaluators** assess payment outcomes and trust evolution over time?
   - What **Routes** should expose for external ILP connector integration and webhook callbacks?
   - What custom **Events** enable inter-agent payment coordination?

2. **Bootstrap Lifecycle Integration**: How should Crosstown's 5-phase BootstrapService map to ElizaOS's agent lifecycle? Should bootstrap run as:
   - A Service that starts when the agent initializes?
   - An Action that the agent can trigger conversationally ("bootstrap my ILP network")?
   - An automatic background process tied to agent startup?
   - What happens when bootstrap fails or stalls at a phase? How does the agent communicate this?

3. **Nostr Identity Management**: How should ElizaOS agents acquire and manage Nostr keypairs?
   - Should each agent have its own Nostr identity (keypair)?
   - How are keypairs stored securely (Character secrets, environment variables, key management service)?
   - How does the agent's Nostr identity relate to its ElizaOS identity?
   - Can multiple agents share a Nostr identity, or is 1:1 mapping required?

4. **Payment Action Design**: How should the "pay" action work end-to-end?
   - What's the conversation flow? ("Pay Alice 5 USD" → discovery → SPSP → trust check → route → confirm)
   - How does the agent resolve "Alice" to a Nostr pubkey? (Memory lookup, Nostr NIP-05 resolution, direct pubkey input?)
   - What trust thresholds trigger confirmation prompts vs automatic execution?
   - How are payment results reported back to the conversation?

5. **Trust-Informed Decision Making**: How should social trust scores influence agent behavior?
   - Should trust scores be a Provider that enriches every conversation about a peer?
   - How do agents reason about trust when deciding to accept payments, extend credit, or route through intermediaries?
   - Can trust scores feed into ElizaOS's memory system for long-term relationship tracking?
   - How do agents handle untrusted peers (social distance > 3)?

6. **State and Memory Integration**: How should payment history, peer relationships, and trust data persist?
   - What ElizaOS Memory types should store payment records, peer info, trust snapshots?
   - How should semantic search over payment history work? ("Show me payments to Alice in January")
   - Should trust scores be computed on-demand or cached in memory?
   - How does the agent's knowledge of its ILP network evolve over its lifetime?

### Secondary Questions (Nice to Have)

7. **Multi-Agent Payment Routing**: How can multiple ElizaOS agents form an ILP payment mesh?
   - Can agents within the same ElizaOS instance route payments to each other?
   - How do agents discover other ElizaOS agents on the Nostr network?
   - What's the model for agent-to-agent payment negotiation?

8. **ILP-Gated Relay as Agent Infrastructure**: Can ElizaOS agents use the Crosstown relay for persistent communication?
   - Should agents pay to write to the relay as part of normal operation?
   - Can the relay serve as an agent's "public memory" or "bulletin board"?
   - How does the pay-per-write model interact with agent economy?

9. **Autonomous Mode Patterns**: What autonomous behaviors should the plugin support?
   - Periodic trust recalculation and peer list maintenance
   - Automatic settlement channel management (open/close based on activity)
   - Proactive payment routing optimization
   - Social graph exploration for new peer discovery

10. **Error Handling and Recovery**: How should the plugin handle failure modes?
    - Relay connectivity issues (reconnection, relay failover)
    - SPSP handshake timeouts (retry with different relays, escalate to user)
    - Trust score disputes (mutual trust asymmetry)
    - ILP packet routing failures (alternate path discovery)
    - Bootstrap phase failures (partial restart, manual intervention)

11. **Character Configuration Patterns**: What Character templates enable effective ILP agents?
    - What personality traits help agents make good payment decisions?
    - What knowledge bases should ILP-enabled agents include?
    - What system prompts guide trust-aware behavior?
    - Are there archetypes? (conservative payer, generous router, trust maximizer)

12. **Performance and Scalability**: What are the resource implications?
    - Nostr relay connection pooling across agents
    - Trust score computation cost at scale (many peers)
    - Memory usage for payment history
    - Concurrent SPSP handshake limits

- Performance and scalability analysis

## Notes

- Crosstown is at 60-75% completion on settlement/ILP flow — the research should account for both current capabilities and planned completion
- The plugin should be designed to work with Crosstown's existing API surface without requiring changes to the core protocol library
- ElizaOS plugin-babylon serves as the strongest reference architecture for a complex integration plugin
- Consider that agents may operate in both conversational mode (human-directed payments) and autonomous mode (self-directed peer management and routing)
- The Nostr identity layer is critical — it's the bridge between ElizaOS agent identity and the Crosstown network identity
