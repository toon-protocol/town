# Crosstown HTTP Mode Integration Test Results

## Test Date

2026-02-20

## Docker Compose Stack Status

✅ All services running and healthy:

- Anvil (local Ethereum): ✅ Running
- Connector (ILP routing): ✅ Healthy
- Crosstown Node (BLS + Relay): ✅ Healthy
- Token Faucet: ✅ Healthy
- Forgejo (Git): ✅ Healthy

## Epic-11 HTTP Mode Validation

### ✅ WORKING

1. **HTTP Mode Client Integration**
   - ✅ Crosstown Docker image rebuilt with `@crosstown/client` package
   - ✅ Container starts successfully in HTTP mode
   - ✅ HTTP connector communication established

2. **ILP Packet Flow**
   - ✅ Connector Admin API responding (peers, routes, balances endpoints)
   - ✅ ILP packets can be sent via `POST /admin/ilp/send`
   - ✅ Routing table configured (route added for `g.crosstown.my-node` -> `local`)
   - ✅ Packets are routed from connector to BLS

3. **Nostr Relay**
   - ✅ Relay accepting WebSocket connections
   - ✅ Clients can query for events (kind:10032 ILP peer info)
   - ✅ Relay serving stored events (1 event published by bootstrap)
   - ✅ REQ/EVENT/EOSE message flow working

4. **Bootstrap Process**
   - ✅ Node publishes ILP info (kind:10032) on startup
   - ✅ Relay monitoring active for peer discovery
   - ✅ HTTP mode connector integration successful

### ⚠️ PARTIAL / NOT FULLY TESTED

1. **Event Publishing with Payment**
   - ⚠️ ILP packets reach BLS but are rejected (HTTP 400)
   - ⚠️ BLS expects TOON-encoded events, test sent JSON-encoded
   - ⚠️ Need proper TOON encoding for full validation

2. **E2E Tests**
   - ⚠️ 3/5 tests passed (lifecycle tests)
   - ⚠️ 2/5 tests failed due to `nostr-tools` Node.js compatibility issue (`window is not defined`)
   - ⚠️ Tests show HTTP mode client can start/stop successfully

### ❌ NOT WORKING / NOT ENABLED

1. **Payment Channels**
   - ❌ Settlement infrastructure not enabled
   - ❌ Response: `{"error":"Service Unavailable","message":"Settlement infrastructure not enabled"}`
   - ❌ BASE blockchain contract addresses not configured
   - ❌ Cause: `BASE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` and `BASE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` env vars not set

2. **Claims Signing**
   - ❌ Cannot test - requires payment channels to be enabled
   - ❌ No claims generated without active channels

3. **Settlement Thresholds**
   - ❌ Cannot test - settlement monitoring not enabled
   - ❌ No balance tracking without payment channels

4. **SPSP Payments**
   - ❌ Not fully tested - requires payment channels for micropayments
   - ⚠️ SPSP server is running but payment validation not tested

## Specific User Questions Answered

### 1. ❓ "Did you try sending packets?"

✅ **YES** - ILP packets successfully sent via HTTP connector

- Packets are accepted by connector (HTTP 200)
- Packets are routed to the correct destination
- BLS receives packets but rejects them (format issue, not routing issue)

### 2. ❓ "Fetching for Nostr events?"

✅ **YES** - Nostr relay fully functional

- Events can be queried via WebSocket
- REQ/EVENT/EOSE protocol working
- 1 event (kind:10032 ILP peer info) stored and retrievable

### 3. ❓ "Validating payment channels are working?"

❌ **NO** - Payment channels NOT enabled

- Settlement infrastructure disabled
- BASE contract addresses not configured
- Need to set `BASE_TOKEN_ADDRESS` and `BASE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS` in environment

### 4. ❓ "Signing claims?"

❌ **NO** - Cannot test without payment channels

- Requires active payment channels
- Requires settlement engine to be running

### 5. ❓ "Hitting settlement thresholds?"

❌ **NO** - Cannot test without payment channels

- Settlement monitoring not enabled
- No threshold tracking active

## What Needs to Be Fixed

### Critical (For Full Payment Testing)

1. **Enable Payment Channels**

   ```bash
   # Get deployed contract addresses from deployer logs
   docker compose -f docker-compose-with-local.yml logs contract-deployer

   # Set in .env or docker-compose
   BASE_TOKEN_ADDRESS=0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
   BASE_REGISTRY_ADDRESS=<address from deployer logs>

   # Restart connector and crosstown
   docker compose -f docker-compose-with-local.yml restart connector crosstown
   ```

2. **Fix TOON Encoding in Tests**
   - BLS expects TOON-encoded events
   - Tests are sending JSON-encoded events
   - Need to use `encodeEventToToon` from `@crosstown/relay`

3. **Fix nostr-tools Node.js Compatibility**
   - E2E tests fail with `window is not defined`
   - Need to mock `window` or use Node.js-compatible WebSocket client

### Nice-to-Have

1. Add test coverage for payment validation
2. Add test coverage for claim signing
3. Add test coverage for settlement thresholds

## Conclusion

**Epic-11 HTTP Mode: ✅ WORKING**

- Core HTTP mode functionality is operational
- Connector ↔ BLS communication established
- ILP packet routing functional

**Payment/Settlement Testing: ❌ BLOCKED**

- Payment channels not configured
- Need BASE contract addresses
- Cannot validate claims or settlement without channels

**Recommendation:** Enable payment channels by configuring BASE contract addresses, then re-run validation tests.
