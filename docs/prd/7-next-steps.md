# 7. Next Steps

## 7.1 Current State

- **Completed:** Epics 1-10 (Foundation, SPSP, Trust, Relay, BLS Docker, Peer Discovery, Settlement, Bootstrap, npm Publishing, Embedded Connector)
- **In Progress:** Epic 11 (NIP Handler Agent Runtime — `packages/agent/`)
- **Planned:** Epics 12-17 (NIP Adoption Roadmap)

## 7.2 Immediate Actions

1. Complete Epic 11: NIP Handler Agent Runtime (`packages/agent/`)
2. Begin Epic 12: Cross-Town Communication Foundation (NIP-05, NIP-17, NIP-25, NIP-40, NIP-46, NIP-65, NIP-09, NIP-56)
3. Expand SocialTrustManager with reaction and report signals
4. Add NIP handler references for Gas Town event kinds (kind:30078 work dispatch, kind:30080 completion, kind:30081 cost report)

## 7.3 Architect Prompt

> You are the Architect for the Crosstown Protocol project. Review the PRD at `docs/prd.md` and the architecture document at `docs/architecture.md`. Key considerations:
>
> - 6-package monorepo: `@crosstown/core`, `@crosstown/bls`, `@crosstown/relay`, `@crosstown/agent`, `@crosstown/examples`, `@crosstown/ui-prototypes`
> - Three integration modes: embedded (createCrosstownNode), HTTP (Admin API), Docker
> - Settlement negotiation during SPSP handshake (chain intersection, payment channels)
> - Layered discovery: genesis → ArDrive → NIP-02
> - Agent runtime with Vercel AI SDK v6 for LLM-powered event processing
> - Gas Town integration as planned work: Gas Town instances are standard protocol peers via NIP-01 WebSocket + ILP BTP/HTTP
> - NIP adoption roadmap (Epics 12-17) restructured for Gas Town convergence
> - [Crosstown x Gas Town Integration Analysis](../research/gastown-integration-analysis.md) drives the roadmap
>
> Review and update the architecture document to maintain alignment with the PRD.
