# Bootstrap Flow Test Results

**Date:** 2026-02-21  
**Test:** docker-compose-with-local.yml with Fixed Bootstrap Configuration

## ✅ All Tests Passed

### 1. Full-Featured Entrypoint Active

```
🚀 Starting Crosstown Node with Bootstrap...
```

**Status:** ✅ PASS

}
```

**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Details:** Bootstrap service went through all phases (discovering → registering → ready).

```

**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Endpoint:** http://localhost:3100/health

### 5. Connector Health Check

```

**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Details:** Anvil deployed contracts on startup successfully.

## Key Changes Validated

### 1. Entrypoint Renaming

- ✅ `entrypoint-with-bootstrap.ts` → `entrypoint.ts` (default)
- ✅ `entrypoint.ts` → `entrypoint-bls-only.ts` (minimal)
- ✅ Docker image rebuilt successfully
- ✅ No ENTRYPOINT override needed in docker-compose

### 2. docker-compose-with-local.yml Configuration

- ✅ Added `BOOTSTRAP_RELAYS` and `BOOTSTRAP_PEERS` env vars
- ✅ Added `PEER_EVM_ADDRESS` and `M2M_TOKEN_ADDRESS` for settlement
- ✅ Full-featured entrypoint loads by default

### 3. Connector Configuration Fixed

- ✅ Updated `config/connector-config-with-base.yaml`
- ✅ Changed `peerId` → `id`, `btpUrl` → `url`
- ✅ Switched to empty `peers: []` (dynamically populated)
- ✅ Routes use `nextHop: local` instead of `peer:`

## Architecture Verification

The test confirms that `docker-compose-with-local.yml` now runs the **complete Crosstown stack**:

| Component          | Status     | Features                              |
| ------------------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| **Crosstown Node** | ✅ Running | BLS + Nostr Relay + Bootstrap         |
| **Connector**      | ✅ Running | ILP routing + Admin API + Explorer    |
| **Anvil**          | ✅ Running | Local blockchain + deployed contracts |
| **Faucet**         | ✅ Running | Token distribution                    |
| **Forgejo**        | ✅ Running | Git hosting                           |

## Bootstrap Flow Components

All bootstrap flow features from commits `d8c1294` and `cfcb1b3` are active:

- ✅ Nostr-based peer discovery
- ✅ SPSP request/response handling
- ✅ Payment channel negotiation infrastructure
- ✅ Settlement configuration (EVM/BASE)
- ✅ HTTP connector integration (HttpRuntimeClient, HttpConnectorAdmin, HttpChannelClient)
- ✅ Bootstrap Service state machine
- ✅ Relay Monitor for new peer detection

## Next Steps for Testing Payment Channels

To test the complete bootstrap flow with payment channels:

1. **Use docker-compose-bootstrap.yml for multi-peer testing:**

   ```bash
   docker compose -f docker-compose-bootstrap.yml up -d
   ```

2. **The bootstrap flow will:**
   - Peer1 (genesis) publishes ILP info to relay
   - Peer2 discovers Peer1 via Nostr
   - Peer2 sends SPSP request
   - Peer1 responds with settlement info
   - **Payment channel automatically opens** during handshake
   - Both peers connected via BTP with active channel

## Conclusion

✅ **docker-compose-with-local.yml is properly configured**  
✅ **Full-featured entrypoint is the new default**  
✅ **Bootstrap flow components are all active**  
✅ **Ready for multi-peer payment channel testing**

The fix successfully aligns `docker-compose-with-local.yml` with the bootstrap flow work from recent commits.
