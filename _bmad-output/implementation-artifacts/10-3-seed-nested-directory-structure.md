# Story 10.3: Seed Script — Nested Directory Structure (Push 2)

Status: ready-for-dev

## Story

As a **TOON developer**,
I want a seed script that adds deeply nested directory structures to the E2E test repository via incremental git push,
so that Playwright specs can verify the known depth navigation bug is fixed and regression-tested at depth 4.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **AC-3.1:** `seed/push-02-nested.ts` adds files at increasing depths: `src/lib/core.ts` (depth 2), `src/lib/utils/format.ts` (depth 3), `src/lib/utils/helpers/deep-file.ts` (depth 4), `docs/guide.md` (depth 1)
2. **AC-3.2:** Only new/changed git objects uploaded (delta from Push 1's SHA map)
3. **AC-3.3:** New commit has parent = Push 1's commit SHA
4. **AC-3.4:** kind:30618 refs updated — main branch advances, arweave map includes all objects from both pushes
5. **AC-3.5:** `runPush02()` returns `Push02State` with appended commits array, expanded shaMap, and updated files list — no direct `state.json` writes (orchestrator handles persistence)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Task 1: Create `push-02-nested.ts` module with file content constants (AC: 3.1)
  - [ ] 1.1: Define content constants for `src/lib/core.ts`, `src/lib/utils/format.ts`, `src/lib/utils/helpers/deep-file.ts`, `docs/guide.md`
  - [ ] 1.2: Export `Push02State` interface extending Push01State with new commit and file entries
  - [ ] 1.3: Export `runPush02` function accepting `(aliceClient, aliceSecretKey, push01State)` parameters
- [ ] Task 2: Build git objects with nested tree structure (AC: 3.1, 3.3)
  - [ ] 2.1: Create 4 new blobs (core.ts, format.ts, deep-file.ts, guide.md)
  - [ ] 2.2: Build nested tree hierarchy bottom-up: `helpers/` tree -> `utils/` tree -> `lib/` tree -> `src/` tree -> root tree (also including `docs/` subtree)
  - [ ] 2.3: Root tree must include ALL entries from Push 1 (README.md, package.json, src/) plus new `docs/` — reuse Push 1 blob SHAs, but trees at `src/` and above are NEW because tree contents changed
  - [ ] 2.4: Create commit with `parentSha` = Push 1 commit SHA, fixed timestamp for determinism
- [ ] Task 3: Upload only delta objects to Arweave (AC: 3.2)
  - [ ] 3.1: Pass accumulated `shaMap` from Push 1 to `uploadGitObject()` — delta logic in `git-builder.ts` skips already-uploaded SHAs
  - [ ] 3.2: Sign per-object balance proofs via `aliceClient.signBalanceProof(channelId, perObjectAmount)` — same pattern as Push 1
  - [ ] 3.3: Validate each upload returns a valid txId (fail-fast per R10-003)
- [ ] Task 4: Publish updated kind:30618 refs (AC: 3.4)
  - [ ] 4.1: Call `buildRepoRefs()` with REPO_ID, updated `{ 'refs/heads/main': newCommitSha }`, and the full accumulated `shaMap` (both Push 1 + Push 2 entries)
  - [ ] 4.2: Sign and publish via `publishWithRetry(aliceClient, refsSigned)`
  - [ ] 4.3: Do NOT re-publish kind:30617 repo announcement (it doesn't change)
- [ ] Task 5: Return updated state (AC: 3.5)
  - [ ] 5.1: Return `Push02State` with appended commits array, expanded shaMap, updated files list
  - [ ] 5.2: State return only — no direct `state.json` writes (orchestrator handles persistence)
- [ ] Task 6: Write ATDD tests (AC: all)
  - [ ] 6.1: Create `__tests__/push-02-nested.test.ts` following push-01-init.test.ts pattern
  - [ ] 6.2: Unit tests for deterministic SHA computation of all 4 new blobs
  - [ ] 6.3: Unit tests for nested tree structure correctness (entries, sorting, SHA references)
  - [ ] 6.4: Unit test verifying commit body contains `parent <push01CommitSha>`
  - [ ] 6.5: Unit test verifying delta logic — only new objects are in the upload list (reused Push 1 blobs like README.md, package.json are NOT re-uploaded)
  - [ ] 6.6: Unit test verifying kind:30618 refs includes arweave tags from BOTH pushes
  - [ ] 6.7: Integration test stubs (`.todo`) for live Arweave DVM upload validation

## Prerequisites

- **Story 10.2 complete:** `push-01-init.ts` must be implemented and its `Push01State` interface available for import.
- **Seed lib from Story 10.1:** All seed lib modules (`git-builder.ts`, `event-builders.ts`, `publish.ts`, `constants.ts`) must be available.
- **SDK E2E infrastructure running:** `./scripts/sdk-e2e-infra.sh up` for integration verification (not required for unit tests).

## Dev Notes

### Critical Pattern: Follow Push 1 Exactly

The implementation MUST follow the exact same patterns established in `push-01-init.ts` (Story 10.2). Key patterns:

1. **Import from barrel**: `import { createGitBlob, createGitTree, createGitCommit, uploadGitObject, buildRepoRefs, publishWithRetry, AGENT_IDENTITIES, type ShaToTxIdMap } from './lib/index.js';`
2. **finalizeEvent for signing**: `import { finalizeEvent } from 'nostr-tools/pure';`
3. **ToonClient type import**: `import type { ToonClient } from '@toon-protocol/client';`
4. **Channel ID retrieval**: `const channelId = aliceClient.getTrackedChannels()[0];`
5. **Balance proof signing**: `aliceClient.signBalanceProof(channelId, BigInt(obj.body.length) * 10n)` — pass per-object delta, NOT cumulative (ChannelManager auto-accumulates internally)
6. **Upload order**: blobs first, then trees leaf-to-root, then commit
7. **Fail-fast on undefined txId**: Check `result.txId` after each upload

### Git Tree Construction — The Tricky Part

Building nested trees requires careful bottom-up construction. The tree hierarchy for Push 2 is:

```
root tree
├── README.md       (blob SHA from Push 1 — REUSED, not re-uploaded)
├── package.json    (blob SHA from Push 1 — REUSED, not re-uploaded)
├── docs/           (NEW tree)
│   └── guide.md    (NEW blob)
└── src/            (NEW tree — different SHA from Push 1 because children changed)
    ├── index.ts    (blob SHA from Push 1 — REUSED)
    └── lib/        (NEW tree)
        ├── core.ts (NEW blob)
        └── utils/  (NEW tree)
            ├── format.ts    (NEW blob)
            └── helpers/     (NEW tree)
                └── deep-file.ts (NEW blob)
```

**Build order (leaf-to-root):**
1. `helpers/` tree (contains deep-file.ts blob)
2. `utils/` tree (contains format.ts blob + helpers/ tree)
3. `lib/` tree (contains core.ts blob + utils/ tree)
4. `src/` tree (contains index.ts blob from Push 1 + lib/ tree) — NEW SHA because lib/ is new
5. `docs/` tree (contains guide.md blob)
6. Root tree (contains README.md blob, package.json blob, src/ tree, docs/ tree)

**Critical**: Even though `README.md`, `package.json`, and `src/index.ts` blob SHAs are reused from Push 1, any tree that has new entries or changed child tree SHAs will produce a NEW tree SHA. The root tree SHA will be different from Push 1's root tree because `src/` subtree changed and `docs/` was added.

### Delta Upload Logic

The `uploadGitObject()` function in `git-builder.ts` already handles delta logic:
```typescript
// Delta logic: skip if already uploaded
const existing = shaMap[sha];
if (existing) {
  return { sha, txId: existing };
}
```

Push 2 reuses blob SHAs from Push 1 (README.md, package.json, index.ts). These will be automatically skipped by the delta check. Only NEW objects need uploading:
- 4 new blobs (core.ts, format.ts, deep-file.ts, guide.md)
- 6 new trees (helpers/, utils/, lib/, src/, docs/, root) — all trees are new because structure changed; root tree SHA differs from Push 1 because `src/` subtree changed and `docs/` was added
- 1 new commit

That's exactly 11 new objects to upload (4 blobs + 6 trees + 1 commit). The 3 reused blobs from Push 1 are skipped by delta logic.

### File Contents — Keep Minimal (R10-005)

Per test design risk R10-005, seed file content must stay well under 95KB. Use short, meaningful content:

```typescript
export const CORE_TS_CONTENT = `export class Core {
  init(): void { /* core initialization */ }
}
`;

export const FORMAT_TS_CONTENT = `export function formatOutput(data: string): string {
  return data.trim();
}
`;

export const DEEP_FILE_TS_CONTENT = `export const DEEP_CONSTANT = 'found-at-depth-4';
`;

export const GUIDE_MD_CONTENT = `# Guide

Getting started with rig-e2e-test-repo.
`;
```

### Commit Determinism

Use a fixed timestamp that is AFTER Push 1's timestamp (1700000000):

```typescript
const commit = createGitCommit({
  treeSha: rootTree.sha,
  parentSha: push01State.commits[0].sha, // Push 1 commit
  authorName: 'Alice',
  authorPubkey: AGENT_IDENTITIES.alice.pubkey,
  message: 'Add nested directory structure',
  timestamp: 1700001000, // 1000 seconds after Push 1
});
```

### State Interface

```typescript
export interface Push02State {
  repoId: string;
  ownerPubkey: string;
  commits: { sha: string; txId: string; message: string }[];
  shaMap: ShaToTxIdMap;
  repoAnnouncementId: string;
  refsEventId: string;
  branches: string[];
  files: string[];
}
```

The `commits` array appends the new commit to Push 1's commits. The `files` array includes all files from both pushes.

### Test Pattern — Follow push-01-init.test.ts

Tests in `__tests__/push-02-nested.test.ts` must follow the same pattern:
- `describe('Story 10.3: Push 02 — Nested Directory Structure')`
- Unit tests use `[P0]` priority tags
- Import via `await import('../push-02-nested.js')` and `await import('../lib/git-builder.js')`
- Infrastructure-dependent tests use `it.todo('[integration] ...')`
- Test deterministic SHA generation by running object creation twice and comparing
- Test tree entry contents by inspecting `body.toString('binary')`

### Key Dependency: Push01State Input

`runPush02` receives the output of `runPush01` (or equivalent state). It needs:
- `push01State.commits[0].sha` — parent commit SHA
- `push01State.shaMap` — accumulated SHA-to-txId map (mutated in-place by uploadGitObject)
- `push01State.repoAnnouncementId` — passed through (not re-published)
- `push01State.repoId` — REPO_ID for refs event

Import `REPO_ID` from `push-01-init.ts` or pass via state — keep consistent.

### Project Structure Notes

- File location: `packages/rig/tests/e2e/seed/push-02-nested.ts`
- Test location: `packages/rig/tests/e2e/seed/__tests__/push-02-nested.test.ts`
- Both files follow the exact naming pattern from Story 10.2
- All imports use `.js` extension (ESM convention per project rules)
- No new dependencies needed — reuses existing seed library from Story 10.1
